The first is to synthesize the important current concepts, definitions, and styles of resolving and/or managing workplace conflicts. The second is to introduce a systematic approach to resolving workplace conflicts. Design/methodology/approach - Historical approaches to conflict management are briefly reviewed and Goldratt's evaporating cloud is introduced as a structured approach to achieving win-win solutions to workplace conflicts. A comprehensive case is used to demonstrate the application of the suggested approach. Findings - Goldratt's evaporating cloud provides a systematic approach to identifying the conflicting needs or interests of the parties to a conflict, and a process for making explicit the assumptions underlying the conflict and challenging their validity, leading to win-win solutions to workplace conflicts. The evaporating cloud incorporates well-accepted principles of achieving win-win solutions and complements existing approaches. Research limitations/implications - Although there is a growing community of users of the evaporating cloud, it is still a relatively new approach. Although anecdotal examples of applications of the cloud have been published in trade journals, web sites and conference proceedings, additional empirical research should be done to evaluate the usefulness of the cloud in resolving workplace conflicts once a critical mass of users exists. Practical implications - The evaporating cloud is a practical and intuitive tool that can be used by employees at all levels of an organization to understand and resolve conflicts. Originality/value - The paper identifies the shortcomings of existing conflict management approaches and shows how the evaporating cloud complements existing approaches. In addition, the applicability of the cloud to a wide range of workplace conflicts, from intra-personal to inter-organizational, is demonstrated.

We find that the posts that are most successful at recruiting active Facebook engagement utilize existing forms of communication, such as sharing pictures and status updates.

While the affluent consumer market is the necessary condition for sustained retail growth, it is the retail deregulation that has been the fundamental driving force for the structural changes in Shanghai's retail sector. Its liberal policies attracted major international retailers to either choose Shanghai as the gateway city to enter the China market, or locate their China headquarters offices in Shanghai to command their operations throughout the country.

This paper focuses on the case of software ""piracy"" to assess the mechanisms by which the new global obligations for the treatment of IPRs are transmitted from the international to the national levels. We first consider a set of national-level factors that many scholars have shown to be important determinants of IPR policy. We then supplement the standard emphasis on domestic factors with an analysis of new transnational factors: countries' multilateral obligations under the World Trade Organization's (WTO) Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) and bilateral pressures from the United States to increase the protection of IPRs. Population-averaged panel data models are used to assess the effects of these national and transnational determinants on levels of software piracy in 80 countries from 1994 to 2002. Our results indicate that membership in the WTO and bilateral pressures from the United States-particularly pressures that offer reciprocal concessions-lead to substantial increases in levels of protection in rich and poor countries.

On the other hand, some academics treat the topic as fanciful, part of a general degradation of modem culture, which in turn, leads them to ignore and sometimes even ridicule research done in the name of the posthuman. Unfortunately - and possibly as a result of this ridicule - those who are willing to write from the former, seem to have an overarching desire to do it from a scientific realist standpoint; as if it was the only legitimate position to take. The result of this has been a number of in-depth articles on the computer dynamics necessary - and the vast scientific and technological advances needed - to achieve computational parity with human neurology. But although it follows that there would be limited desire to ""upgrade"" the human by plugging it into something deemed ""inferior""; the scientific realist perspective has resulted in the timeframe for fundamental posthuman change being one of centuries, rather than decades.

The results showed a moderate, but statistically significant, improvement in the effectiveness of HRM, and of the corporate HRM unit, as the host organization went through corporatization. Perceptions on HR effectiveness were not found to vary significantly between the different stakeholder groups. Regression analysis showed that the major predictors of the improvement in the overall effectiveness of the corporate HR unit were, firstly, changes in the level of satisfaction with the quality of the HR outcomes as a result of commercialization and, secondly, the change in extent to which the senior HR practitioner had effective influence over strategic decision-making processes.","Public Administration,Industrial Relations & Labor",not explicitly computational,True,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,0,0.7288274967731672,0.4593114611438932,0.5092488527297974,-0.4794330596923828,Not Computational,Not Computational

Each of these agencies has argued that the GS system is an impediment to their efforts to accomplish their mission and achieve their strategic goals. The list will continue to grow. The new model for salary management that has been adopted or proposed in these agencies is based on the broadband concept. Within the bands, pay for performance is the basis for managing salaries. That policy change has been the focus of heated debates. While it is effectively a universal practice for white-collar employees in non-government sectors, it represents a radical and difficult change for public agencies. 1 The new model also makes it necessary to rethink the strategy for aligning salaries with prevailing market pay levels. The locality pay concept adopted under the Federal Employee Pay Comparability Act (FEPCA) was never allowed to operate as planned, and probably has lost too much credibility to be resuscitated.

As women continue to advance into managerial ranks, a closer examination of both supervisor and subordinate gender with regard to harassment consequences is warranted. In this research, we examine with a sample of 130 municipal court clerks whether gender impacts harasser punishment, the degree to which harassers are considered responsible for harassment, and the degree to which the harassment is perceived as serious. The design is a 2x2x2 factorial, with independent variables of harasser (male/female), harassee (male/female), and harassment type (quid pro quo, hostile environment). Contrary to what was hypothesized, men who harassed women were viewed more responsible for the harassment than men who harassed men, while a corresponding difference did not occur for women. Similarly, sexual harassment was viewed most seriously when men harassed women. When it came to administering punishment, however, women who harassed men were given more stringent punishment, providing support for views held by society regarding the appropriateness of men's and women's sexual behavior.

Selectively over the decades, some of this planning was oriented toward insuring that government could continue to function following a disaster.

States with a divided government or high party competition tended not to adopt several key electoral reforms, while partisanship and the interaction of partisanship and minority representation influenced the adoption of others. Fiscal constraints and institutional arrangements had less impact on reform adoption.

There were no incumbents and no party labels in the nonpartisan contests. In low-information local elections such as these, voter cues and ballot design plays a decisive role in voter choice. The cues in this election were candidates' gender, ethnicity, campaign expenditures, and ballot position. Our results indicate that the most important cue was candidate gender; however, voters used ethnicity to decide whether they voted for men or women. The number of candidates on the ballot impacted vote share, while ballot position played no significant role. Those candidates who spent the most campaign money were also preferred.

I use mixed-modeling techniques to model incremental year-to-year changes in per them rates and payments per recipient and event history analysis and ordered logit to model non-incremental comprehensive innovation in this policy area. My results indicate that federal action prompted non-incremental change in capital reimbursement policy by limiting state discretion over incremental year-to-year spending decisions. Incremental policy appears to be affected by regional diffusion, but there is no evidence of this effect for non-incremental policy. Furthermore, when a state's fiscal health declined and the demand for government services grew, it was more likely to respond by making incremental adjustments than non-incremental system overhauls. Whereas governing capacity influenced both incremental and non-incremental change, state ideology influenced only incremental change.
