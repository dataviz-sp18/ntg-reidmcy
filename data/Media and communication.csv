These systems enable users to take advantage of their personal information when combined with information provided by others who are willing to attain similar objectives. However, the importance of that kind of social information can also be applied to other fields in which the information is not directly provided by users, but comes from historical evidence or indirect sources. This is especially relevant to creating knowledge representations that attempt to reconstruct the social networks of celebrities or historical characters.

The research aimed to provide empirical evidence based on a case study of a particular arena of creativity, namely electro-acoustic music composition. However, it also sought to identify issues that may apply more widely to other arenas of human creativity. Design/methodology/approach - The research was based on a related series of three in-depth studies of electro-acoustic music composers at work. These studies entailed the collection of qualitative data from interviews, observations and ""think aloud"" protocols. These data were analysed inductively to reveal concepts and relationships that formed the basis for a model of interactions between the composers and the information systems with which they were working. Findings - The paper presents a model of relationships between information system features and use, and the resulting effects in terms of the extent to which creativity was perceived by the composers to have been facilitated and inhibited. In particular, a number of tensions were identified which suggest that conventional ""best practice"" in the design of data-intensive information systems may be fundamentally at odds with the requirements of such systems to support important aspects of creativity. Research limitations/implications - The limitations associated with in-depth qualitative research based on small samples is acknowledged, relating in particular to its lack of ability to generalise on the basis of statistical probability. However, Such an approach arguably offers the complementary strength of being particularly suited to exploratory research aimed essentially at charting new territory and identifying rich and possibly unanticipated constructs rather than testing hypotheses based on existing theory. The resultant findings, however, must remain tentative and provisional pending further systematic investigation designed to establish the extent to which they are generalisable. Practical implications - As well as identifying limitations in conventional approaches to designing data-intensive information systems, an alternative architecture is proposed which seeks better to map onto the requirements of creativity support. It is hoped that both the criticisms of conventional approaches and the proposed novel architecture may be of practical use to those engaged in the design of data-intensive creativity support systems. Originality/value - The research reported here offers a novel perspective on the design of information systems in that it identifies a tension between conventional ""best practice"" in system design and the requirements of important aspects of creativity support.

This has provided the evidence base upon which to make informed observations on the efficacy of cutting-edge automatic annotation techniques which seek to integrate the text-based and content-based image retrieval paradigms. Findings - Evidence from the real-world practice of image retrieval highlights the existence of a generic-specific continuum of object identification, and the incidence of temporal, spatial, significance and abstract concept facets, manifest in textual indexing and real-query scenarios but often having no directly visible presence in an image. These factors combine to limit the functionality of current semantic image retrieval techniques, which interpret only visible features at the generic extremity of the generic-specific continuum.

The issue of physical and digital spaces as places for work, collaboration, and community-building is considered. Findings - As more digital libraries are built, and as more physical libraries offer electronic access to parts of their collection, two trends are likely to result: the role of the library as a storage space for materials will become decreasingly important, and the role of the library as a space for users, for individual and collaborative work, and as a space for social activity, will become increasingly important.

Design/methodology/approach - Starting from a Foucauldian notion of discourse, ""information poverty"" is examined as a statement in its relation to other statements in order to highlight assumptions and factors contributing to its construction. The analysis is based on repeated and close reading of 35 English language articles published in LIS journals between 1995 and 2005. Findings - Four especially productive discursive procedures are identified: economic determinism, technological determinism and the ""information society"", historicising the ""information poor"", and the library profession's moral obligation and responsibility.

Therefore, results and findings are fully applicable only in an English language context.

Design/methodology/approach - The Web intelligence techniques in this study are a combination of link analysis (web structure mining), web server log file analysis (web usage mining), and text analysis (web content mining), utilizing the power of commercial search engines and drawing upon the information science fields of bibliometrics and webometrics. LexiURL is a computer program designed to calculate summary statistics for lists of links or URLs.

Not many links directed to the NeLH were followed on September 25, 2005 (the date of the log file analysis and link extraction analysis), which means that users who access the digital library have been arriving at the site via only a few select links, bookmarks and search engine searches, or non-electronic sources.

Design/methodology/approach - This discourse analysis identifies the syntactic and content indicators and patterns of formality levels in a purposive sample of 402 chat transcripts (covering 6,572 minutes) from one academic year at a large, US, public university. Findings - Syntactic formality markers include regular use of contractions, slang, sentence fragments, and non-standard punctuation as well as limited use of acronyms and abbreviations with rare use of emoticons. Content-based markers included apologies, self-disclosure, and expressions of extreme need. Use patterns are related to the level of responsibility assumed by the librarian as well as the interview stages. Research limitations/implications - A limited data source and potential coder bias are the two limitations of this study. The research implications point to the need for chat reference librarians to assume greater control of formality nuances in order to encourage a more effective search for the user. Practical implications - The fundamentals of politeness theory, particularly in terms of formality indicators, should be incorporated into staff training and behavioral standards for reference librarians. While future research is needed to determine the most effective means of employing this theoretical construct, this study implies that: a self-reflective, culturally sensitive use of the nuances of formality can enhance the user's experience.

In particular, it seeks to discover the extent to which the constructs locus of control and attribution theory might provide useful frameworks for understanding searchers' perceptions. Design/methodology/approach - A combination of inductive and deductive approaches were employed. Perceptions of failed and successful searches were derived from the inductive analysis of using open-ended qualitative interviews with a sample of 37 biologists at the University of Sheffield. These perceptions were classified into ""internal"" and ""external"" attributions, and the relationships between these categories and ""successful"" and ""failed"" searches were analysed deductively to test the extent to which they might be explainable using locus of control and attribution theory interpretive frameworks. Findings - All searchers were readily able to recall ""successful"" and ""unsuccessful"" searches. In a large majority of cases (82.4 per cent), they clearly attributed each search to either internal (e.g. ability or effort) or external (e.g. luck or information not being available) factors. The pattern of such relationships was analysed, and mapped onto those that would be predicted by locus of control and attribution theory. The authors conclude that the potential of these theoretical frameworks to illuminate one's understanding of web searching, and associated training, merits further systematic study. Research limitations/implications - The findings are based on a relatively small sample of academic and research staff in a particular subject area. Importantly, also, the study can at best provide a prima facie case for further systematic study since, although the patterns of attribution behaviour accord with those predictable by locus of control and attribution theory, data relating to the predictive elements of these theories (e.g. levels of confidence and achievement) were not available. This issue is discussed, and recommendations made for further work. Originality/value - The findings provide some empirical support for the notion that locus of control and attribution theory might - subject to the limitations noted above - be potentially useful theoretical frameworks for helping us better understand web-based information seeking.

The study reported here seeks to investigate such perceptions and reactions, and to explore the extent to which Simon's ""bounded rationality"" theory is useful in illuminating these issues. Design/methodology/approach - Totally 37 academic staff, research staff and research students in three university departments were interviewed about their web searching. The open-ended, semi-structured interviews were inductively analysed. Emergence of the concept of ""good enough"" searching prompted a further analysis to explore the extent to which the data could be interpreted in terms of Simon's concepts of ""bounded rationality"" and ""satisficing"". Findings - The results indicate that the risk of missing potentially important information was a matter of concern to the interviewees. Their estimations of the likely extent and importance of missed information affected decisions by individuals as to when to stop searching - decisions based on very different criteria, which map well onto Simon's concepts. On the basis of the interview data, the authors propose tentative categorizations of perceptions of the risk of missing information including ""inconsequential"" ""tolerable"" ""damaging"" and ""disastrous"" and search strategies including ""perfunctory"" ""minimalist"" ""nervous"" and ""extensive"". It is concluded that there is at least a prima facie case for bounded rationality and satisficing being considered as potentially useful concepts in our quest better to understand aspects of human information behaviour. Research limitations/implications - Although the findings are based on a relatively small sample and an exploratory qualitative analysis, it is argued that the study raises a number of interesting questions, and has implications for both the development of theory and practice in the areas of web searching and information literacy.

Design/methodology/approach - Marketing managers in 141 large computer services businesses completed a questionnaire concerning the extents to which they used books, marketing magazines, academic journals, and grey literature (GL) for instrumental, conceptual, and symbolic purposes. Four ""motivating factors"" (e.g. occupational learning orientation) were examined plus three other influences (e.g. length of time in a marketing role). The possible consequences of the extensive use of various sources were explored. Findings - only 2 per cent of the sample read academic marketing journals, and just 3 per cent looked at marketing textbooks. However, 89 per cent of the sample accessed (mainly internet-based) grey marketing literature and 62 per cent read marketing magazines. Nearly, one in six of the respondents stated that they had read practitioner ""how to do"" marketing books. Several hypothesised independent variables exerted positive and significant impacts on the degrees to which magazines; GL, and practitioner books were employed to obtain marketing knowledge. Research limitations/implications - It was not possible to examine exactly why a particular knowledge source was preferred for a specific purpose. Potential connections between past academic research outputs and the contents of contemporary grey marketing literature and articles in marketing magazines could not be investigated. The results imply that GL must be recognised as a vital source of marketing knowledge. Issues relating to the codification and wider distribution of GL, copyright, the shortage of specialised GL bibliographies in the marketing area, and the long-term availability of materials in electronic form need to be addressed.

Design/methodology/approach - Facet analysis provides an established rigorous methodology for the conceptual organization of a subject field, and the structuring of an associated classification or controlled vocabulary. This paper explains how that methodology was applied to the humanities in the FATKS project, where the objective was to explore the potential of facet analytical theory for creating a controlled vocabulary for the humanities, and to establish the requirements of a faceted classification appropriate to an online environment. A detailed faceted vocabulary was developed for two areas of the humanities within a broader facet framework for the whole of knowledge. Research issues included how to create a data model which made the faceted structure explicit and machine-readable and provided to its further development and use. Findings - In order to support easy facet combination in indexing, and facet searching and browsing on the interface, faceted classification requires a formalized data structure and an appropriate tool for its management. The conceptual framework of a faceted system proper can be applied satisfactorily to humanities, and fully integrated within a vocabulary management system. Research limitation/implications - The procedures described in this paper are concerned only with the structuring of the classification, and do not extend to indexing, retrieval and application issues. Practical implications - Many stakeholders in the domian of resource discovery consider developing their own classification system and supporting tools.

Design/methodology/approach - The research is based on in-depth interviews with 21 practitioners and analysis of activity in cross-organizational spaces, such as an online community and a series of annual practitioner conferences on the web in HE (1997), Findings - The cross-organizational spaces have Support and symbolic roles as well as informational ones. They have overlapping but different membership and agendas. Key factors that govern individual participation and so the shape of cross-organizational spaces are differential involvement in technical innovation, degree of organizational embedding or marginality, differences in organizational position and role, orientation towards centralization or decentralization and orientation towards marketing or IT. There is some sense of occupational community among web managers, but within that also diversity and a significant fracture line between marketing and IT perspectives on the role. This may explain the lack of formal professionalization. As a more natural boundary practice between organizations than marketing, IT has more public visibility, possibly influencing the course jurisdictional struggles over who should control the web. Originality/value - Most studies of knowledge sharing have focussed on the factors, which influence it within an organization, yet cross-organizational sharing is also of importance, even for established professions as the boundaries of organizations become more open. For new occupations cross-organizational ties may be a critical resource, and not only for sharing information or support, but for making sense of what the job is about at the deepest level.

Geography as a factor in relevance is little understood and information seeking is assumed to take place in indoor environments. Yet the rise of information seeking on the move using mobile devices implies the need to better understand the kind of situational relevance operating in this kind of context. Design/methodology/approach - The paper outlines and explores a geographic information seeking process in which geographic information needs (conditioned by needs and tasks, in context) drive the acquisition and use of geographic information objects, which in turn influence geographic behaviour in the environment Geographic relevance is defined as ""a relation between a geographic information need"" (like an attention span) and ""the spatio-temporal expression of the geographic information objects needed to satisfy it"" (like an area of influence). Some empirical examples are given to indicate the theoretical and practical application of this work. Findings - The paper sets out definitions of geographical information needs based on cognitive and geographic criteria, and proposes four canonical cases, which might be theorised as anomalous states of geographic knowledge (ASGK). The paper argues that geographic relevance is best defined as a spatio-temporally extended relation between information need (an ""attention"" span) and geographic information object (a zone of ""influence""), and it defines four domains of geographic relevance. Finally a model of geographic relevance is suggested in which attention and influence are modelled as map layers whose intersection can define the nature of the relation.

Usage analyses were further examined with regard to the following user characteristics: subscriber/non-subscriber; referrer link employed, organisational affiliation; geographical location. Findings - The analysis showed that the rise in use of NAR over the survey period (140 per cent) could largely be attributed to the opening up of the site to search engines and that the move to OA had a relatively small influence on driving usage up further (less than 10 per cent).

For half a century LIS has been caught in an identity crisis that divided the field artificially between library and information science, a division that mirrored implicit distinctions between people and technology orientations, between qualitative and quantitative methods and between impressionist and scientific identities.

While the field argued, the world moved on and other disciplines took LIS-based problems of information organization, management and use as their own, threatening some within LIS but encouraging others to embrace a broader, more theoretically-driven conception of our problem space. With the emergence of a networked knowledge society where information plays key economic, social and cultural roles, there are two broad futures for LIS research, neither of which is necessarily wrong but which will force upon the field a choice of identity.

Descriptions of the evolution of the user-centred approach in information science tend to lean towards accepting the interpretation of the decontextualized and system-centred nature of traditional information needs and uses studies presented in the seminal 1986 review article by Brenda Dervin and Michael Nilan. Method. A sample of early user studies and comprehensive reviews of user studies written in 1950s and 1960s were reviewed and compared to the interpretative context set by the Dervin and Nilan 1986 article. Analysis. This comparison captures some of the varying meanings and interpretations given to concepts such as information systems, information sources and information needs in different decades. Results. Dervin and Nilan's description of the nature of traditional user studies drew major insights from other contemporary articles working toward building a better general conceptualization of information for information science. Dervin and Nilan did not incorporate in their review early user studies conducted between 1950s and 1970s, which would have mandated different conclusions. Conclusions. Despite the fact that early user studies usually did have an implicit or explicit aim to support the flow of scientific information through the design of information systems or products, scholarly communication and reading habits were in many early user studies explored quite user-sensitively in their natural contexts. Studies by, for instance, Menzel, Parker and Paisley, Allen and Gerstberger, and Garvey focused on information and communication practices conceived very broadly, incorporating not only information seeking but also information receiving and sharing, reading, writing, and publishing activities.",Information Science & Library Science,not explicitly computational,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,0,0.876464531778527,0.3014471815590153,0.9870929121971129,-0.9722750186920166,Computational,Not Computational

One problem with creating universal information systems has been the presence of unacknowledged bias. Systems that are designed for discrete discourse communities, as in the domain analytic approach described by Hjorland and Albrechtsen (1995), can be seen as a response to such problems of bias. Method. Through an extended analysis, this paper contends, however, that bias remains in the domain analytic approach. The root of this bias lies in the continued sense, in the writings on domain analysis, that the representation of knowledge structures is a type of scientific discovery: the documentation of a true reality, as opposed to an actively designed interpretation of reality. Results. This paper suggests that a more inclusive approach to information system design might involve the definition and justification of a particular stance toward the information, as appropriate for the use context of a particular system. Conclusions. If we cannot eliminate bias, then we should instead attempt to be more responsible about it and explicitly decide on and defend the perspectives represented in information systems. According to this type of approach, which draws on the idea of situated knowledges as expressed by Donna Haraway, the freedom to define a particular perspective for one situation also enables the definition of alternative stances for other design situations, allowing a diversity of opinions to flower.

Design/methodology/approach - The study adopts a mixed methodology. In-depth qualitative data gathered through vignette interviews (n = 28), group exercises (four groups of between three and five teachers) and a discussion forum were supplemented by quantitative data gathered through surveys of teachers (n = 312), head teachers (n = 78), school librarians (n = 78) and school library services (n = 26). Findings - Teachers' professional use of research information reflects a preference for predigested information and informal sources. Although professional bodies and government departments promote the use of research by teachers and provide a range of customised web sites for information, lack of ready local access to information and lack of time were cited as major barriers to the use of research information. Teachers also revealed uncertainties and lack of confidence in their own ability to find and evaluate such information. The findings suggest scope for more targeted provision by school librarians of both information and skills to support the professional development of teachers. However, this raises issues of priorities and resources, and needs to be seen in the context of a wider change in ethos supported by senior management. The study also raises questions about teachers' own experiences and approaches to the use of information in professional learning, and how this might impact on the provision of support for their pupils and the potential for collaborative working between librarians and teachers. Research limitations/implications - The qualitative aspects of the study provided a rich source of data from teachers with varying levels of experience and involvement with the use of research information. However, a low response to the teacher questionnaire survey (10.9 per cent, overall, 312 teachers) resulted in a bias towards more research-oriented teachers in that particular data set. While the data from research-oriented teachers do appear to triangulate, it is difficult to generalise to other teachers. Therefore teacher survey data have been treated with some caution and drawn on only to aid further understanding of the issues raised in interviews and group exercises.

Many employees now work-from home for at least part of the time, or store corporate data on their home computers or other mobile devices, potentially placing corporate assets at risk of a data breach. Any organization that suffers a breach faces potentially significant financial, legal, and reputation repercussions. Further, unsecured home computers are increasingly compromised and subsequently used to launch attacks on third parties or to spread spam, viruses, or other malicious software. This article considers the leadership role that IT executives can play in helping to promote security on their employees' home computers. It presents the results from a survey of U.S. adults who work full-time, use a computer at work, and access the internet at home. Our preliminary finding is that employer-sponsored security awareness and training programs can influence people to secure their computers at home. We measured both attitudes and behavior related to home computer security and assessed differences between individuals who had been exposed to employer-sponsored awareness and training programs and those who had not been exposed to such programs. We found that those who had been exposed to these programs scored significantly higher on factors that influence behavior and were also more likely to report that they engaged in behaviors to protect their home computers. However a majority of survey respondents reported that they had not been exposed to training and awareness campaigns related to home computer security. We conclude, therefore, that organizations are missing a key opportunity to protect their own networks and data. Home computer security should be a top management priority, and we provide recommendations for developing security awareness and training programs as part of a comprehensive risk management program.(2)","Information Science & Library Science,Management",not explicitly computational,True,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,0,0.8377694413070513,0.3409638375466527,0.8057100772857666,-0.8360143303871155,Not Computational,Not Computational

Presenting a critique of the traditional professionalization concept, cogent arguments are found for rejecting a universal code of ethics. By acknowledging the limitations and even deficiencies of such codified morality, a journalist's responsibility is emphasized and a different concept of ethics is indicated. Ethical journalists in this international context must focus on responsibility, positive tolerance, and empathy that transcends mere obedience to a code.
