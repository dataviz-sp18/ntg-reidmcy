These processes comprise part of the circuit of culture, a cultural studies model that describes the relationships among the production, representation, consumption, regulation, and identity of cultural artefacts (Hall 1997). Our analysis reveals important differences in the ways in which mainstream and alternative sites represent lesbians and their health concerns. Whereas there is a clear division between producer and consumer roles on mainstream sites, on alternative sites these roles converge; that is, the producers of information content are also its consumers, with the result that the sites differ significantly in their objectives and their positioning of the health concerns of site users.",Information Science & Library Science,True,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,0,0.9641505088661562,0.18623280009952595,1.780733346939087,-1.5111846923828125

Design/methodology/approach - In October 2006, data collected over a two-week period via Microsoft SharePoint, the software which supports the intranet, were examined in order to explore overall levels of use of the library pages, differences in interest between girls and boys, variations in use among youngsters in the particular year groups and the extent to which use changed over time. Findings - Although an equal number of girls and boys visited the library pages, the former recorded more hits. Use was greatest among Year Eleven females but few youngsters of either gender or any age returned to the library section on a day subsequent to their initial visit. Interest fell away rapidly within days of the principal phase of data collection commencing. Research limitations/implications - The data employed were limited to the usage figures provided by the SharePoint log. Future research should, if possible, address whether the new intranet section has led to greater use of the actual library.

The research aimed to provide empirical evidence based on a case study of a particular arena of creativity, namely electro-acoustic music composition. However, it also sought to identify issues that may apply more widely to other arenas of human creativity. Design/methodology/approach - The research was based on a related series of three in-depth studies of electro-acoustic music composers at work. These studies entailed the collection of qualitative data from interviews, observations and ""think aloud"" protocols. These data were analysed inductively to reveal concepts and relationships that formed the basis for a model of interactions between the composers and the information systems with which they were working. Findings - The paper presents a model of relationships between information system features and use, and the resulting effects in terms of the extent to which creativity was perceived by the composers to have been facilitated and inhibited. In particular, a number of tensions were identified which suggest that conventional ""best practice"" in the design of data-intensive information systems may be fundamentally at odds with the requirements of such systems to support important aspects of creativity. Research limitations/implications - The limitations associated with in-depth qualitative research based on small samples is acknowledged, relating in particular to its lack of ability to generalise on the basis of statistical probability. However, Such an approach arguably offers the complementary strength of being particularly suited to exploratory research aimed essentially at charting new territory and identifying rich and possibly unanticipated constructs rather than testing hypotheses based on existing theory. The resultant findings, however, must remain tentative and provisional pending further systematic investigation designed to establish the extent to which they are generalisable. Practical implications - As well as identifying limitations in conventional approaches to designing data-intensive information systems, an alternative architecture is proposed which seeks better to map onto the requirements of creativity support. It is hoped that both the criticisms of conventional approaches and the proposed novel architecture may be of practical use to those engaged in the design of data-intensive creativity support systems. Originality/value - The research reported here offers a novel perspective on the design of information systems in that it identifies a tension between conventional ""best practice"" in system design and the requirements of important aspects of creativity support.

This has provided the evidence base upon which to make informed observations on the efficacy of cutting-edge automatic annotation techniques which seek to integrate the text-based and content-based image retrieval paradigms. Findings - Evidence from the real-world practice of image retrieval highlights the existence of a generic-specific continuum of object identification, and the incidence of temporal, spatial, significance and abstract concept facets, manifest in textual indexing and real-query scenarios but often having no directly visible presence in an image. These factors combine to limit the functionality of current semantic image retrieval techniques, which interpret only visible features at the generic extremity of the generic-specific continuum.

The issue of physical and digital spaces as places for work, collaboration, and community-building is considered. Findings - As more digital libraries are built, and as more physical libraries offer electronic access to parts of their collection, two trends are likely to result: the role of the library as a storage space for materials will become decreasingly important, and the role of the library as a space for users, for individual and collaborative work, and as a space for social activity, will become increasingly important.

Design/methodology/approach - Starting from a Foucauldian notion of discourse, ""information poverty"" is examined as a statement in its relation to other statements in order to highlight assumptions and factors contributing to its construction. The analysis is based on repeated and close reading of 35 English language articles published in LIS journals between 1995 and 2005. Findings - Four especially productive discursive procedures are identified: economic determinism, technological determinism and the ""information society"", historicising the ""information poor"", and the library profession's moral obligation and responsibility.

Therefore, results and findings are fully applicable only in an English language context.

Design/methodology/approach - The Web intelligence techniques in this study are a combination of link analysis (web structure mining), web server log file analysis (web usage mining), and text analysis (web content mining), utilizing the power of commercial search engines and drawing upon the information science fields of bibliometrics and webometrics. LexiURL is a computer program designed to calculate summary statistics for lists of links or URLs. Its output is a series of standard reports, for example listing and counting all of the different domain names in the data.

Design/methodology/approach - Similarities between citation patterns and social closeness were identified and discussed. A total of 16 individuals in the citation network were identified and investigated using citation analysis, and a matrix formed of citations made between those in the network. Social connections between the 16 in the citation network were then investigated by means of a questionnaire, the results of which were merged into a separate matrix. These matrices were converted into visual social networks, using multidimensional scaling. A new deviance measure was devised for drawing comparisons between social and citation closeness in individual cases. Findings - Nicholas, Williams and Huntington were found to have cited 527 authors in the period 2000-2003, the 16 most cited becoming the subjects of further citation and social investigation. This comparison, along with the examination of visual representations indicates a positive correlation between social closeness and citation counts.

Design/methodology/approach - This discourse analysis identifies the syntactic and content indicators and patterns of formality levels in a purposive sample of 402 chat transcripts (covering 6,572 minutes) from one academic year at a large, US, public university. Findings - Syntactic formality markers include regular use of contractions, slang, sentence fragments, and non-standard punctuation as well as limited use of acronyms and abbreviations with rare use of emoticons. Content-based markers included apologies, self-disclosure, and expressions of extreme need. Use patterns are related to the level of responsibility assumed by the librarian as well as the interview stages. Research limitations/implications - A limited data source and potential coder bias are the two limitations of this study. The research implications point to the need for chat reference librarians to assume greater control of formality nuances in order to encourage a more effective search for the user. Practical implications - The fundamentals of politeness theory, particularly in terms of formality indicators, should be incorporated into staff training and behavioral standards for reference librarians. While future research is needed to determine the most effective means of employing this theoretical construct, this study implies that: a self-reflective, culturally sensitive use of the nuances of formality can enhance the user's experience.

In particular, it seeks to discover the extent to which the constructs locus of control and attribution theory might provide useful frameworks for understanding searchers' perceptions. Design/methodology/approach - A combination of inductive and deductive approaches were employed. Perceptions of failed and successful searches were derived from the inductive analysis of using open-ended qualitative interviews with a sample of 37 biologists at the University of Sheffield. These perceptions were classified into ""internal"" and ""external"" attributions, and the relationships between these categories and ""successful"" and ""failed"" searches were analysed deductively to test the extent to which they might be explainable using locus of control and attribution theory interpretive frameworks. Findings - All searchers were readily able to recall ""successful"" and ""unsuccessful"" searches. In a large majority of cases (82.4 per cent), they clearly attributed each search to either internal (e.g. ability or effort) or external (e.g. luck or information not being available) factors. The pattern of such relationships was analysed, and mapped onto those that would be predicted by locus of control and attribution theory. The authors conclude that the potential of these theoretical frameworks to illuminate one's understanding of web searching, and associated training, merits further systematic study. Research limitations/implications - The findings are based on a relatively small sample of academic and research staff in a particular subject area. Importantly, also, the study can at best provide a prima facie case for further systematic study since, although the patterns of attribution behaviour accord with those predictable by locus of control and attribution theory, data relating to the predictive elements of these theories (e.g. levels of confidence and achievement) were not available. This issue is discussed, and recommendations made for further work. Originality/value - The findings provide some empirical support for the notion that locus of control and attribution theory might - subject to the limitations noted above - be potentially useful theoretical frameworks for helping us better understand web-based information seeking. If so, they could have implications particularly for better understanding of searchers' motivations, and for the design and development of more effective search training programmes.",Information Science & Library Science,True,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,1,0.5161805347317171,0.6447954416949998,-0.00031467713415622717,-0.06505942344665527

The study reported here seeks to investigate such perceptions and reactions, and to explore the extent to which Simon's ""bounded rationality"" theory is useful in illuminating these issues. Design/methodology/approach - Totally 37 academic staff, research staff and research students in three university departments were interviewed about their web searching. The open-ended, semi-structured interviews were inductively analysed. Emergence of the concept of ""good enough"" searching prompted a further analysis to explore the extent to which the data could be interpreted in terms of Simon's concepts of ""bounded rationality"" and ""satisficing"". Findings - The results indicate that the risk of missing potentially important information was a matter of concern to the interviewees. Their estimations of the likely extent and importance of missed information affected decisions by individuals as to when to stop searching - decisions based on very different criteria, which map well onto Simon's concepts. On the basis of the interview data, the authors propose tentative categorizations of perceptions of the risk of missing information including ""inconsequential"" ""tolerable"" ""damaging"" and ""disastrous"" and search strategies including ""perfunctory"" ""minimalist"" ""nervous"" and ""extensive"". It is concluded that there is at least a prima facie case for bounded rationality and satisficing being considered as potentially useful concepts in our quest better to understand aspects of human information behaviour. Research limitations/implications - Although the findings are based on a relatively small sample and an exploratory qualitative analysis, it is argued that the study raises a number of interesting questions, and has implications for both the development of theory and practice in the areas of web searching and information literacy. Originality/value - The paper focuses on an aspect of web searching which has not to date been well explored.

Design/methodology/approach - Marketing managers in 141 large computer services businesses completed a questionnaire concerning the extents to which they used books, marketing magazines, academic journals, and grey literature (GL) for instrumental, conceptual, and symbolic purposes. Four ""motivating factors"" (e.g. occupational learning orientation) were examined plus three other influences (e.g. length of time in a marketing role). The possible consequences of the extensive use of various sources were explored. Findings - only 2 per cent of the sample read academic marketing journals, and just 3 per cent looked at marketing textbooks. However, 89 per cent of the sample accessed (mainly internet-based) grey marketing literature and 62 per cent read marketing magazines. Nearly, one in six of the respondents stated that they had read practitioner ""how to do"" marketing books. Several hypothesised independent variables exerted positive and significant impacts on the degrees to which magazines; GL, and practitioner books were employed to obtain marketing knowledge. Research limitations/implications - It was not possible to examine exactly why a particular knowledge source was preferred for a specific purpose. Potential connections between past academic research outputs and the contents of contemporary grey marketing literature and articles in marketing magazines could not be investigated. The results imply that GL must be recognised as a vital source of marketing knowledge.

Design/methodology/approach - Facet analysis provides an established rigorous methodology for the conceptual organization of a subject field, and the structuring of an associated classification or controlled vocabulary. This paper explains how that methodology was applied to the humanities in the FATKS project, where the objective was to explore the potential of facet analytical theory for creating a controlled vocabulary for the humanities, and to establish the requirements of a faceted classification appropriate to an online environment. A detailed faceted vocabulary was developed for two areas of the humanities within a broader facet framework for the whole of knowledge. Research issues included how to create a data model which made the faceted structure explicit and machine-readable and provided to its further development and use. Findings - In order to support easy facet combination in indexing, and facet searching and browsing on the interface, faceted classification requires a formalized data structure and an appropriate tool for its management. The conceptual framework of a faceted system proper can be applied satisfactorily to humanities, and fully integrated within a vocabulary management system. Research limitation/implications - The procedures described in this paper are concerned only with the structuring of the classification, and do not extend to indexing, retrieval and application issues. Practical implications - Many stakeholders in the domian of resource discovery consider developing their own classification system and supporting tools.

Design/methodology/approach - The research is based on in-depth interviews with 21 practitioners and analysis of activity in cross-organizational spaces, such as an online community and a series of annual practitioner conferences on the web in HE (1997), Findings - The cross-organizational spaces have Support and symbolic roles as well as informational ones. They have overlapping but different membership and agendas. Key factors that govern individual participation and so the shape of cross-organizational spaces are differential involvement in technical innovation, degree of organizational embedding or marginality, differences in organizational position and role, orientation towards centralization or decentralization and orientation towards marketing or IT. There is some sense of occupational community among web managers, but within that also diversity and a significant fracture line between marketing and IT perspectives on the role. This may explain the lack of formal professionalization. As a more natural boundary practice between organizations than marketing, IT has more public visibility, possibly influencing the course jurisdictional struggles over who should control the web. Originality/value - Most studies of knowledge sharing have focussed on the factors, which influence it within an organization, yet cross-organizational sharing is also of importance, even for established professions as the boundaries of organizations become more open. For new occupations cross-organizational ties may be a critical resource, and not only for sharing information or support, but for making sense of what the job is about at the deepest level.

Design/methodology/approach - The study adopts a mixed methodology. In-depth qualitative data gathered through vignette interviews (n = 28), group exercises (four groups of between three and five teachers) and a discussion forum were supplemented by quantitative data gathered through surveys of teachers (n = 312), head teachers (n = 78), school librarians (n = 78) and school library services (n = 26). Findings - Teachers' professional use of research information reflects a preference for predigested information and informal sources. Although professional bodies and government departments promote the use of research by teachers and provide a range of customised web sites for information, lack of ready local access to information and lack of time were cited as major barriers to the use of research information. Teachers also revealed uncertainties and lack of confidence in their own ability to find and evaluate such information. The findings suggest scope for more targeted provision by school librarians of both information and skills to support the professional development of teachers. However, this raises issues of priorities and resources, and needs to be seen in the context of a wider change in ethos supported by senior management. The study also raises questions about teachers' own experiences and approaches to the use of information in professional learning, and how this might impact on the provision of support for their pupils and the potential for collaborative working between librarians and teachers. Research limitations/implications - The qualitative aspects of the study provided a rich source of data from teachers with varying levels of experience and involvement with the use of research information. However, a low response to the teacher questionnaire survey (10.9 per cent, overall, 312 teachers) resulted in a bias towards more research-oriented teachers in that particular data set. While the data from research-oriented teachers do appear to triangulate, it is difficult to generalise to other teachers. Therefore teacher survey data have been treated with some caution and drawn on only to aid further understanding of the issues raised in interviews and group exercises.

Geography as a factor in relevance is little understood and information seeking is assumed to take place in indoor environments. Yet the rise of information seeking on the move using mobile devices implies the need to better understand the kind of situational relevance operating in this kind of context.

Some empirical examples are given to indicate the theoretical and practical application of this work. Findings - The paper sets out definitions of geographical information needs based on cognitive and geographic criteria, and proposes four canonical cases, which might be theorised as anomalous states of geographic knowledge (ASGK). The paper argues that geographic relevance is best defined as a spatio-temporally extended relation between information need (an ""attention"" span) and geographic information object (a zone of ""influence""), and it defines four domains of geographic relevance.

This article revisits the narrative of the user-centred turn. Descriptions of the evolution of the user-centred approach in information science tend to lean towards accepting the interpretation of the decontextualized and system-centred nature of traditional information needs and uses studies presented in the seminal 1986 review article by Brenda Dervin and Michael Nilan. Method. A sample of early user studies and comprehensive reviews of user studies written in 1950s and 1960s were reviewed and compared to the interpretative context set by the Dervin and Nilan 1986 article. Analysis. This comparison captures some of the varying meanings and interpretations given to concepts such as information systems, information sources and information needs in different decades. Results. Dervin and Nilan's description of the nature of traditional user studies drew major insights from other contemporary articles working toward building a better general conceptualization of information for information science. Dervin and Nilan did not incorporate in their review early user studies conducted between 1950s and 1970s, which would have mandated different conclusions. Conclusions. Despite the fact that early user studies usually did have an implicit or explicit aim to support the flow of scientific information through the design of information systems or products, scholarly communication and reading habits were in many early user studies explored quite user-sensitively in their natural contexts.

One problem with creating universal information systems has been the presence of unacknowledged bias. Systems that are designed for discrete discourse communities, as in the domain analytic approach described by Hjorland and Albrechtsen (1995), can be seen as a response to such problems of bias. Method. Through an extended analysis, this paper contends, however, that bias remains in the domain analytic approach. The root of this bias lies in the continued sense, in the writings on domain analysis, that the representation of knowledge structures is a type of scientific discovery: the documentation of a true reality, as opposed to an actively designed interpretation of reality. Results. This paper suggests that a more inclusive approach to information system design might involve the definition and justification of a particular stance toward the information, as appropriate for the use context of a particular system. Conclusions. If we cannot eliminate bias, then we should instead attempt to be more responsible about it and explicitly decide on and defend the perspectives represented in information systems. According to this type of approach, which draws on the idea of situated knowledges as expressed by Donna Haraway, the freedom to define a particular perspective for one situation also enables the definition of alternative stances for other design situations, allowing a diversity of opinions to flower.

This paper presents a theoretical framework for examining information practices in socio-material contexts that draws on research in the library and information science and human computer interaction ( human computer interaction) communities. Method. The paper is framed around questions of theorizing computer-mediated information practices. The first part of the paper discusses three important notions of value for library and information science research drawn from human computer interaction and computer-supported, co-operative work research: interaction, embodiment and practice. The second part of the paper translates these theoretical foundations into analytical devices for library and information science research by presenting two approaches ( Jean Lave's ""setting"" & ""arena"" and Susan Leigh Star's ""boundary objects""), offering two illustrations for each of value for library and information science research. Analysis. Applying these foundations addresses two conditions of human experience essential for library and information science research to acknowledge in the study of information practices in context: 1) the situated, embodied character of human experience; and 2) a socio-material ( and increasingly socio-technical) context brought more actively into our examinations and analysis. Results. Each approach contributes to studying information practices by identifying and analysing the socio-material context in which they unfold.

Information science is a divergent research field which includes many subfields with diverse perspectives. They are influenced by different schools of thought and when ""turns"" are introduced, there will be many attempting to turn the field in different directions. Results. Different turns have various implications for the research field. The metaphor of ""the turn"" is highly flexible and the research field can be bent in many different ways and in a more or less fundamental manner. The situation of information science being a relatively small research field, including many subdisciplines and perspectives serves as a setting for a divergent field with many turns in different directions. However, several ideas that address a more fundamental turn, that would make the field more convergent, is discussed in the article. Conclusions. An image of a stronger more convergent research field is often a hidden implication of a turn.

Willingness to adopt new technologies is key to their successful implementation in libraries.

Frequently missing from this belief system is a consideration of the effect that employees' willingness to adopt new innovations might have on successful diffusion and the realization of these two beliefs.

We recruited subjects by individual e-mails to the users of RefWorks - a web-based personal reference management tool installed for use at the University of Minnesota. To participate, subjects needed to give their consent and share their references with us. 96 subjects participated, majority ( 65) of who were graduate students, resulting into 30,336 references. Based on the type of the reference, these were stratified into one of the three valid identifying IDs-DOI, ISBN, or URL. Multiple reference resolvers (CrossRef, WorldCat) were used to enhance the overall resolvability of these collections. Analysis. Descriptive statistics and simple graphics analysis were used to describe the dataset. Results. Over 90% of the total references in users' personal collections could possibly have a valid ID (DOI, ISBN, URL), and therefore, are potentially resolvable. However, only about 17% of the references in these collections had a valid ID, and fewer than 11% actually resolved successfully. Using a combination of reference resolvers, the total resolvability of the references in these collections was enhanced from under 11% to over 41%. Conclusions. Users' personal reference collections have a tremendous potential of building, supporting, and enhancing personalized digital library services, such as reference recommender systems.",Information Science & Library Science,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,0,0.7792695250209142,0.4069199196593225,0.635303258895874,-0.6261113286018372

Qualitative interviewing has been the main method for data collection. Analysis. Interview transcripts have been content analysed in relation to case histories of the original study. Results. The original study of the group in the late 1980s showed that interaction between group members was frequent and integrated social, collegial and informational aspects. They served as informal information providers for each other and their information seeking was predominantly internal within the department. It is clear from preliminary results of the follow-up study that the pattern of social interaction between the remaining five group members has changed dramatically. Today collegial interaction is mostly limited to the individuals' research teams. Social interaction and interaction for information purposes among the subjects are sparse. In Talja's (2002) terminology they have moved from social sharing within the group of team leaders to strategic sharing within their research teams. The scientists studied still prefer informal information seeking, but their information interaction is now mostly external and the social qualities of this interaction have changed. Conclusions.

Development. Past research has documented the value of lay information mediary behaviour to individual and organizational success. However, previous general information seeking models have not considered lay information mediary behaviour in-depth. Conclusion.

Today, many people would answer that ""I have been on the net"", or that ""I have googled"". This implies that the theory of public knowledge has entered a new phase. We need to know how knowledge should be defined and categorized in relation to what is increasingly called a ""knowledge society"". However, the theory of knowledge in sociological contexts such as knowledge economy, knowledge management, knowledge sharing and knowledge organizations ( including, of course, libraries) lacks a common definition and categorization. It is the ambition of the present paper ( and of earlier publications, e. g., Qvortrup 2001, 2004 and 2006) to suggest a well-defined concept and categorization. In this paper knowledge is defined as confirmed observations, and it is suggested that knowledge can be classified into four categories based on a system of hetero- and self-observation, i.e. a system of knowledge of the environment and knowledge of knowledge. In my development of this definition and categories I refer primarily to sociological and organizational theory. It is, however, my assumption that in order to qualify the sociological definition of knowledge one can benefit from referring to the vast amount of philosophical analyses and theories of knowledge.

Dramatic changes in society and in the information disciplines and professions constituted the basis for a re-conceptualization of the content of the Encyclopedia of Library and Information Sciences. Method. Marcia J. Bates and Mary Niles Maack, Editors of the forthcoming Third Edition, working with a fifty-person Editorial Advisory Board, developed the new, projected contents list for the encyclopedia, based upon principles developed in the re-conceptualization. Analysis. Drawing on Bates' ""Invisible Substrate of Information Science"" article, and other sources, the information disciplines are seen as consisting of the ""disciplines of the cultural record"" and the ""information sciences."" These disciplines are all concerned with the collection, organization and access to information, across the entire traditional spectrum of disciplines, such as the humanities and natural and social sciences.

The disciplines covered in the encyclopedia are library and information science, archival science, records management, information systems, informatics, knowledge management, museum studies, bibliography, document and genre studies, and social studies of information. A variety of cognate disciplines are briefly covered as well. Conclusions. The information disciplines are coming into their own in the 21st century.

As critical theory and LIS share the same core assumptions, by choosing to critique itself LIS may expose contradictions in order to actualize a new identity for its role in the future. Development After a discussion of critical theory's view of knowledge and society, the paper contrasts themes from critical theory to LIS practice and its self-image to suggest why LIS needs critique to consider its own ideologically-infused behaviors, the external view and internal concerns that LIS lacks theory and a basis as an intellectual activity, the possibility of objectification of others for processing, and how the warrant for LIS activities, through accrediting bodies, is inconsistent and perhaps actually ""colonizes the lifeworld"" of those LIS claims to help as well as its own practitioners.

The preliminary finding presented in this paper is that specific types of artefacts may be linked to certain stages in the information life cycle.

The paper addresses our understanding of the library, focusing on the notion of 'userism', making it specific to the notions of object and legitimatisation 'userism'. Analysis. A library theory and concept should provide us with the basis for understanding the various possible intelligible aspects of the library. The paper discusses library theories that can be derived from three major subfields of library and information science: information retrieval, information seeking, and information management, and their inherent 'userism'. These views of the library could be summarized as views of the library as a resource. They are challenged through the hermeneutical and political aspects of human social and cultural existence. We perhaps should not only understand the library as a resource, but as publicity and heritage-to be able to understand, for instance, the genuinely educational and political aspects of the library as well.

Research into how information literacy is experienced in the workplace has led to a reconceptualization of the phenomenon as a complex sociocultural and corporeal process that is constituted through a range of information modalities. Method. The research reported is situated within a qualitative framework and employs a constructivist influenced grounded theory approach. Two studies were conductedone of firefighters, conducted in 2005, and the second, of ambulance officers, completed in 2007. In both studies, two phases of in-depth interviews were conducted and practitioners were observed in daily practice. Analysis. Common themes and perspectives have emerged revealing the similarities of experience and use of information in learning to become a worker. In preparatory training, novice workers engage with epistemic sites of knowledge in the processes of learning to act as practitioner. An outcome of this engagement is the development of a workplace identity. It is not until they experience the realities of the workplace that novices begin the transition of learning to become a practitioner. This transition is afforded through the mediation of the community of practice and is centralized around the introduction of context-dependent social and corporeal sites. This change results in a transition from subjective workplace identity to an intersubjective workplace identity as novices learn to become practitioners. Results. The results of this research suggest information literacy is more than just a textual practice. It is a complex sociocultural and embodied process that is constituted through the whole body experiencing information in context. Conclusions.

The survival of the library and information science programme compelled the staff to find ways to connect the generalist information skills already part of their teaching programme more visibly to other programme areas within the Faculty.

A semi-structured interview process was used for getting the story behind each participant's experience. Questions began with a 'stimulus' quotation from recent literature and were open-ended in nature. A stratified purposive sample of information professionals for whom information management or library and information science is an essential component of their occupation was used. Interviews, conducted during June to August 2006, were tape-recorded and transcribed. Analysis. Context and meaning in the interviews was explored through content analysis using NVivo (TM) software.

When one component provides a service that the Web application requires, it is often not possible to bind the two systems together if they were not programmed to have compatible collaboration specifications. Modeling the adaptation between a Web application and external assets becomes therefore an essential issue in any realistic model-driven development scenario. However, most of the existing Web Engineering proposals do not take this issue into account, or they simply address it at the implementation level (in a platform-specific way). In this work, we discuss the problems involved in dealing with component adaptation within the context of Model-Driven Web Engineering and show how design patterns can help addressing it. We first identify the major interoperability problems that can happen when integrating third-party application or legacy systems into our Web systems, and then propose the mechanisms that need to be put in place at the design level to generate the appropriate specification of adapters that compensate for the possible mismatches and differences. We base our proposal on well-known design patterns as they are established solutions to recurring problems, and the generation of code from them is normally straightforward.

We adopt the theoretical approach of strategic contradiction, in which apparently contradictory pairs of elements can be managed by attending to their possible synergies or clarifying their distinctions so as to make balanced trade-offs over time. Our data reveal four sets of paradoxical frames in hybrid teams: remoteness-closeness, cultural uniformity-cultural diversity, rationality-emotionality, and control-empowerment. In referencing these paradoxical frames, teams engaged in three cognitive processes: (a) integrating to produce synergies between opposing tensions, (b) differentiating to clarify distinctions between opposing tensions and to balance trade-offs over time, and (c) polarizing to remove tensions between opposing elements by using one element to reduce the effects of another. Both integrating and differentiating processes were found to be instrumental to sustaining contradictions as interdependent dualities, whereas polarizing processes were found to preserve contradictions as dualisms. Our findings advance the understanding of managing strategic contradictions by showing how managers influence cognitive processes that paradoxically emphasize remoteness and closeness, cultural uniformity and cultural diversity, rationality and emotionality, and control and empowerment.

We apply the concept of distributed leadership, examining how leadership roles are distributed across different individuals in the organisation during developing and implementing a knowledge sharing system. The results of a case study demonstrate that the leadership was fulfilled by the interdependent and emergent roles played by several individuals: the spearheading and coordinating roles of a knowledgeable and persistent project leader, the supporting and steering roles carried by a group of perceptive and collaboration-inclined executives, and the knowledge sharing and momentum driving roles performed by knowledge champions. Each of these leadership influences was indispensable. None of the leaders could have accomplished this task individually, without the active involvement of the other types of leaders. This research makes its contribution to the understanding of the emergence and dynamics of distributed leadership in the information system environment, and demonstrates the importance of a full awareness of distributed leadership as tasks are carried out in developing a knowledge sharing system.

This paper integrates the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) with charismatic leadership theory, and examines the role of project champions influencing user adoption. PLS analysis of survey data collected from 209 employees in seven organizations that had engaged in a large-scale IT implementation revealed that project champion charisma was positively associated with increased performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence and facilitating condition perceptions of users.

Scholars report that a variety of factors are vital to EB success. A shortcoming in the extant EB literature is that much of the research focuses on a small subset of success factors and an overall ranking of factors is still missing. Our aim, therefore, is to synthesise and test the critical success factors (CSFs) identified in the existing literature, thus, substantiating or not the factors purported to be critical. To achieve our aim, we created a survey instrument from a synthesis of CSFs identified from existing EB and e-commerce literature. We draw upon the e-commerce body of knowledge to take in the widest set of CSFs that can affect EB. Data were collected from U. K.-based financial sector organisations that offer EB services. We found the most critical factors for success in EB are: quick responsive products/services, organisational flexibility, services expansion, systems integration and enhanced customer service. Our research shows that organisations need to manage their EB initiative at a strategic level and treat it as business critical rather than simply a technical or operational issue. They need to pay attention to internal integration, which includes channels, technology and business process integration, and improving the overall services to their customers.
