Participants were 14 students enrolled in a graduate course on advanced instructional design. The case was presented to students using two hypermedia structures, hierarchical (tree-like structure) and heterarchical (network-like structure). Results from analyses of four data sources revealed that problem solutions developed in response to the heterarchical case design were more cogent and convincing than problem solutions developed in response to the hierarchical case design. Specifically, the heterarchical case solutions provided evidence of a heuristic problem-solving process facilitating the identification of an expert-like solution to the case and the articulation of learners' understanding and application of grounded and engaging instructional designs.","Education & Educational Research,Education & Educational Research",not explicitly computational,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,1,0.2345596426413221,0.8902342294431473,-0.5396509170532227,0.6430904865264893,Computational,Computational

As a result of extensive qualitative research, standardized multiple-choice tests such as Force Concept Inventory and Force-Motion Concept Evaluation tests provide instructors tools to probe their students' conceptual knowledge of physics. However, many existing quantitative analysis methods often focus on a binary question of whether a student answers a question correctly or not. This greatly limits the capacity of using the standardized multiple-choice tests in assessing students' alternative knowledge. In addition, the context dependence issue, which suggests that a student may apply the correct knowledge in some situations and revert to use alternative types of knowledge in others, is often treated as random noise in current analyses. In this paper, we present a model analysis, which applies qualitative research to establish a quantitative representation framework. With this method, students' alternative knowledge and the probabilities for students to use such knowledge in a range of equivalent contexts can be quantitatively assessed. This provides a way to analyze research-based multiple choice questions, which can generate much richer information than what is available from score-based analysis.","Education, Scientific Disciplines,Education & Educational Research",not explicitly computational,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,1,0.4700382799845694,0.6981857960580735,-0.036258138716220856,0.0837325006723404,Computational,Computational

We find that student strategy often varies with representation, and that in this environment students who show more strategy variation tend to perform more poorly. We also verify that student performance depends sensitively on the particular combination of representation, topic, and student prior knowledge. Finally, we confirm that students have generally robust opinions of their representational skills, and that these opinions correlate poorly with their actual performances.","Education, Scientific Disciplines,Education & Educational Research",not explicitly computational,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,0,0.9024003528739822,0.2773108287620592,1.163647174835205,-1.0605372190475464,Computational,Not Computational

A particular research task required us to locate examples of students calling the teaching assistants (TAs) over for assistance with a physics question. To our surprise, examples of this kind of interaction were difficult to find. We undertook a systematic study of TA-student interactions in tutorial: In particular, how are the interactions initiated? Do the students call the TA over for help with a particular issue, does the TA stop by spontaneously, or does the worksheet require a discussion with the TA at that point? The initiation of the interaction is of particular interest because it provides evidence of the motivation for and purpose of the interaction. This paper presents the results of that systematic investigation. We discovered that the majority of student-TA interactions in tutorial are initiated by teaching assistants, confirmed our initial observation that relatively few interactions are initiated by students, and found, further, that even fewer interactions are worksheet initiated. Perhaps most importantly, we found that our sense of who initiates tutorial interactions-based on extensive but informal observations-is not necessarily accurate. We need systematic investigations to uncover the reality of our classroom experiences.","Education, Scientific Disciplines,Education & Educational Research",not explicitly computational,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,0,0.7124333345206846,0.4818366749470568,0.4954774081707001,-0.4117542207241057,Computational,Not Computational

In particular, focus is on the continuity of active and passive membership, the geographical distribution, and the international connectivity of the community. Contrary to expectations, only a relatively small number of people have participated continuously in the community. Concerning the geographical distribution, we found that the community is increasingly international in conference participation, authors, and program committees. The international connectivity of the community is also increasing, which can be seen in a growing number of citations and co-authorships across different countries.

The currently dominant paradigms for supporting pedagogical design within CSCL, including socio-cultural theory, are limited in the support that they can offer to the project of teaching general thinking skills. This paper uses critical literature review, conceptual analysis, and evidence from case studies to argue for the value of a dialogic interpretative framework that links the goal of teaching thinking with the method of CSCL. The evidence reviewed suggests that dialogue is itself the primary thinking skill from which all others are derived. It is argued from this that dialogic theory offers a possible solution to the problem of how to conceptualize general thinking skills for CSCL: this is that teaching dialogue as an end in itself promotes the learning of general thinking skills. Implications of the proposed framework for pedagogical design are brought out through case studies illustrating the use of CSCL to broaden and deepen dialogic spaces of reflection.","Information Science & Library Science,Education & Educational Research",not explicitly computational,False,True,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,0,0.8525577497082126,0.3210495658495916,0.8463374376296997,-0.908466935157776,Computational,Not Computational

We develop our argument by working through a selection of relevant studies belonging to the two perspectives, and conclude that not enough attention has been given to the emergent characteristics of activities where CSCL tools have been introduced. This is particularly the case in studies belonging to a systemic approach. Our basic argument is that a dialogic stance can provide important insights into how institutional practices shape the meanings and functions of CSCL tools. A dialogic perspective provides opportunities for making sense of learning and knowledge construction at different levels of activity, while at the same time retaining sensitivity to the mutually constitutive relationship between levels.","Information Science & Library Science,Education & Educational Research",not explicitly computational,False,True,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,0,0.8355149373382688,0.3552825558235532,0.8496226668357849,-0.7756057977676392,Computational,Not Computational

These four aspects are explicitly specified in a set of models that serve as parameters for the generic environment. This opens the possibility of combining many structuring/scaffolding techniques that have been proposed in isolation in the CSCL literature. The paper also emphasizes the specificities and difficulties of evaluating a comprehensive generic support approach. Experimental evaluations conducted by system designers generally isolate the effects of a particular design feature on learning. This kind of evaluation can hardly demonstrate the usefulness of a generic model at the global level and the feasibility of system customization by non-specialist teachers.

This difference in orientation produces a more constructive collaboration in the system for anchored discussion, versus a more debate-like collaboration in the forum discussion. Additionally, while messages in the traditional forum resemble usual discussion or email conversation and contain social and regulative comments, discussion in the system for anchored discussion is seen to be more efficient and ""to-the-point.'' We conclude that for collaborative text comprehension by undergraduate students, anchored discussion might be more suitable than traditional forum discussion.

These scenarios show that the analysis techniques and data collection and processing tools are flexible enough to be applied in different conditions. In particular, SAMSA, a tool that processes interaction data to allow social network analysis, is useful with different types of interactions (indirect asynchronous or direct synchronous interactions) and different data representations. Furthermore, the predefined types of social networks and indexes selected are shown to be appropriate for measuring structural aspects of interaction in these CSCL scenarios. These elements are usable and their results comprehensible by education practitioners.

This paper represents a stage in our developing understanding, over a 3 year period, of the impact of group dynamics on online interaction among physiotherapy students engaged in sharing with their peers their first experiences of clinical practice. The literature exploring online interaction tends to situate meaning either in theories borrowed from conventional face-to-face interaction or on virtual interaction. Research focusing on 'blended learning' that combines face-to-face and online interaction is limited in terms of considering how group dynamics impact groups that are constituted and reconstituted in the two very different learning contexts. Using a case study approach, the authors consider how group dynamics change as groups move from face-to-face to online collaboration in pursuit of learning objectives. We characterize typical features of the cases and draw conclusions based on similarities and differences. Findings suggest that group learning is linked to group cohesion, which appears to be mediated by social and cognitive factors that students bring with them. Social presence appears vital to positive group dynamics and is a precursor to cognitive presence, which develops when groups rise above their desire to be sociable and supportive. Group dynamics, whether positive or negative, and their consequent impact on interaction appear to be relatively stable across contexts once the group scene is set through face-to-face interaction. Engagement and interaction of individual students, however, can alter when face-to-face interaction moves online.","Information Science & Library Science,Education & Educational Research",not explicitly computational,False,True,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,0,0.8879179736201613,0.2852295502920856,1.0321053266525269,-1.0375430583953855,Computational,Not Computational

We have learned that among the children we have studied in Colorado, group deficits in reading (dyslexia) and individual differences in reading across the normal range are primarily due to genetic influences, and these genetic influences are often shared with some of the same genetic influences on deficits and individual differences in language and ADHD. We have also learned from our molecular-genetic linkage studies that there are regions on several chromosomes likely to contain genes that influence dyslexia. Several specific genes within these regions have been tentatively identified through molecular-genetic association analyses, but much more research is needed to understand the pathways among specific genes, regions of noncoding DNA that regulate the activity of those genes, the brain, and dyslexia.

In the first year, an extensive battery of assessments was used including aspects of reading, arithmetic, and working memory. Teachers rated the children on 7-point scales on various motivational dimensions summarized to a total score tentatively called task orientation. In the follow-up assessment one year later, the testing and teacher ratings were repeated. The cross-sectional correlations between reading, arithmetic, and task orientation were all high (about +.70). The high correlation between reading and arithmetic decreased significantly when task orientation was partialed out, and it was further reduced when working memory as assessed by backward digit span was added to the controlling factors. Also, teacher ratings of cognitive ability and language development accounted for some of the common variance between reading and arithmetic. The correlation between task orientation and school achievement cannot be causally interpreted in cross-sectional designs. Some support for a ""causal"" hypothesis, however, was obtained in crosslagged correlation analyses indicating that task orientation in Grade 3 may have a causal impact on the level of performance in reading, and in arithmetic in Grade 4.

However, higher level processes often depend on lower level processes, such as letter and word identification, and deficient lower level processing can inhibit reading comprehension (Koda, 1990).

Two experiments compare the reading processes of native Arabic speakers to the reading processes of native English speakers and non-Arabic ESL, learners and provide some evidence that native Arabic speakers are less aware of vowel letters in English texts than either control group.

However, some nonnative varieties, such as Singapore English (SE) appear not to deaccent given information. The present article seeks to investigate the apparent absence of deaccenting in SE by attempting a cross-varietal comparison with British English (BE). The data comprise three main categories of given information: repeated lexical items, anaphoric reference, and sentences that Cue deaccenting by inference. Results indicate that SE speakers showed no acoustic evidence of prosodically attenuating given information unlike their BE counterparts and that in the informational domain, SE does not appear to have a comparable prosodic means of signaling ne v and given information. Implications are given for the international intelligibility of nonnative varieties of English that do not distinguish between new and old information via differences in accent placement.

Ethnographic and action research data illustrate how negotiations of meanings in multicultural, multilingual EFL/EIL contexts go well beyond mere linguistic features to include cultural and gender identity struggles. Five students serve as case studies to consider five alternative patterns of identity and language negotiations: rejection, assimilation, marginality, bicultural accommmodation, and intercultural creativity. The author relates these cross-cultural identity negotiations to various gender identity stances.

This research explored language learning motivation constructs in a Chinese cultural setting, where large numbers of students are required to study English. In Taiwan, 567 language learners responded to a survey concerning motivation orientation, expectancy, and self-evaluated skill. Factor analysis and structural equation modeling were used to explore potential relationships within the framework of the process model. Expectancy was found to be an intervening construct between motivation orientations and self-evaluated skill. The strongest link to expectancy was the required motivation, with the integrative motivation playing no significant role. The context of these findings is discussed in relation to Chinese cultural and educational history and a proposed motivator-the Chinese Imperative.

A sample of 252 secondary school graduates from different parts of the country completed a questionnaire on various instructional practices. Analyses of the data revealed that whereas classroom instruction in socioeconomically developed regions has taken on some features of communicative language teaching (CLT), instructional practices in the less developed areas are still characterized by traditional language teaching methodologies. The regional differences in instructional practices are traced to various economic, social, and cultural factors. The analysis shows that what transpires in the foreign language classroom is inevitably shaped and constrained by contextual influences. This conclusion high-lights the need for an ecological perspective to replace the technological one that predominates in international endeavors to reform language education.
