We have learned that among the children we have studied in Colorado, group deficits in reading (dyslexia) and individual differences in reading across the normal range are primarily due to genetic influences, and these genetic influences are often shared with some of the same genetic influences on deficits and individual differences in language and ADHD. We have also learned from our molecular-genetic linkage studies that there are regions on several chromosomes likely to contain genes that influence dyslexia. Several specific genes within these regions have been tentatively identified through molecular-genetic association analyses, but much more research is needed to understand the pathways among specific genes, regions of noncoding DNA that regulate the activity of those genes, the brain, and dyslexia.

However, higher level processes often depend on lower level processes, such as letter and word identification, and deficient lower level processing can inhibit reading comprehension (Koda, 1990).

However, many existing quantitative analysis methods often focus on a binary question of whether a student answers a question correctly or not. This greatly limits the capacity of using the standardized multiple-choice tests in assessing students' alternative knowledge.

A particular research task required us to locate examples of students calling the teaching assistants (TAs) over for assistance with a physics question. To our surprise, examples of this kind of interaction were difficult to find. We undertook a systematic study of TA-student interactions in tutorial: In particular, how are the interactions initiated? Do the students call the TA over for help with a particular issue, does the TA stop by spontaneously, or does the worksheet require a discussion with the TA at that point? The initiation of the interaction is of particular interest because it provides evidence of the motivation for and purpose of the interaction. This paper presents the results of that systematic investigation. We discovered that the majority of student-TA interactions in tutorial are initiated by teaching assistants, confirmed our initial observation that relatively few interactions are initiated by students, and found, further, that even fewer interactions are worksheet initiated. Perhaps most importantly, we found that our sense of who initiates tutorial interactions-based on extensive but informal observations-is not necessarily accurate.

One approach has aimed at determining the external validity of each diagnosis by investigating whether developmental language history, which differentiates AS from HFA, is relevant in long-term linguistic outcomes. Ail alternative approach, viewing AS and HFA as presentations on an autism spectrum (ASD), has investigated Subgroups within the spectrum based on linguistic performance. Neither approach, however, has provided an in-depth description of the linguistic difficulties experienced in ASD necessary for therapy planning. Purpose: To provide clinically applicable research findings to extend the clinical understanding of the linguistic difficulties in ASD by: (I) comparing the linguistic skills in ASD with those of normally developing controls (2) comparing the linguistic skills of children with ASD re-classified as AS and HFA using DSM-IV language criterion; (3) documenting the heterogeneity within a group of children with ASD by investigating within-group differences. Methods and procedures: Twenty children (aged 9; 0-17; 1 years) with a diagnosis of ASD were assessed using the Clinical Evaluation of Language Fundamentals-Fourth Edition (CELF-4) and the Test of Nonverbal Intelligence Second Edition (TONI-2). Performance by ASD participants was compared to typically developing peers. Re-classification of individuals with ASD its AS or HFA was undertaken using DSM-IV language criterion to determine between-group differences on linguistic measures. Hiearchical cluster analysis was undertaken using the ASD performance oil the CELF-4 to examine within-group differences based oil linguistic abilities. Outcomes and results: There were significant differences between the ASD children and normally developing peers oil a range of linguistic measures. There were no significant differences between the children re-classified as AS and HFA on the comprehensive linguistic assessment. Subgroups within ASD, based oil linguistic performance, could be identified. Conclusions and implications: Collectively, the children with ASD in the study had a range of compromised linguistic skills relative to their peers. Children re-classified as AS could not be differentiated from children re-classified as HFA on current linguistic performance. An examination Of Subgroups of ASD participants revealed the heterogeneous nature of the linguistic skills associated with ASD, where linguistic proficiency ranged from above average performance to severe difficulties. The results of the study are discussed in terms of the clinical applicability of the findings. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Before the study began, the boy was taught to make verbal responses when shown 15 photographs of physical education activities and equipment. During baseline and teaching, probes of target words relevant to the photographs (e.g., slide, swing) were conducted in discrete-trial sessions. When teaching began, three sets of tat-get sight words were successively superimposed oil photographs of the corresponding activities and backgrounds were then faded by removing portions of the photographs until only the text was visible. After all fading steps were completed, the student correctly read 14-15 of the 15 target words and these skills maintained on a 44-day follow up probe. Further, generalization Measures showed that reading skills transferred across text size and color. Superimposition and background fading quickly expanded the sight-word reading repertoire of a youngster with autism. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Parent-reported ASD diagnosis, education department recorded autism special education classification, ADI-R autism, and ADOS autism and ASD were considered as alternative criterion measures of ASD diagnosis. The validity of the SCQ in this population was examined, with a special focus on examining alternative cut-points for indicating ASD. The predictive ability of the SCQ in this population was comparable to that reported for other samples. In addition, findings suggested that a cut-point below the recommended threshold would likely be useful for research studies seeking to identify ASD cases from the population of children receiving special education services. The cut-point selected for use in clinical settings may, however, differ. (C) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.
