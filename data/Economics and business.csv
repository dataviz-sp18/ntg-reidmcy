While lacking the interdependencies of input-output, the simpler model captures the first order effects of the rate decreases. Comparing the results of the two methods yields roughly the same results ($2.5 billion/year welfare trapezoids for twenty strongly regulated states) in the aggregate. Given the simple model's ability to replicate the results of the more complex model, the simple model is then used to estimate the welfare gains using intrastate flow volumes from 1993 and from 1995 rate decrease estimates collected anecdotally from shippers, carriers, state motor freight associations, residual state regulatory agencies, rate bureaus, freight rate auditors, and other professional and government organizations and agencies.

'Youth', as a category of opposition to elders, became important during the inter-war period as it was inhabited by educated African bureaucrats aspiring to representation in urban politics over the traditional claims of authority by local ethnic Zaramo and Shomvi elders. This group of bureaucrats grew in power through the popularization of racial-nationalist politics, and in the 1950s formed the Tanganyika African Nationalist Party (TANU), which instituted its own category of 'youth' with the creation of the TANU Youth League (TYL). Consisting mainly of young, under-employed men who failed to obtain sufficient educational qualifications, the Youth League challenged the late colonial state's theoretical monopoly over violence through voluntary and aggressive policing activities. After the work of independence was complete, there was practical way to demobilize this enormous, semi-autonomous police and intelligence-gathering force. The repeated reassertion of party control over its Youth League took many forms in the decade after independence - through the creation of a National Service and the militarization of development; frequent nationalist events and rituals where Youth League members controlled public space; and a war on urban morality led by Youth League shock troops. Control over youth also offered a potentially autonomous patrimony for ambitious TANU party members. The 1970s witnessed the beginning of the general failure of both state and party to generate sufficient resources to serve as a patron to patron-seeking youth, which has effectively decentralized youth violence and vigilantism ever since. A political history of 'youth', both as a social category and political institution, can shed further light on contemporary dilemmas of youth violence, meanings of citizenship, and hidden motors of party politics.","Area Studies,Anthropology",False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,0.0,0.9622207490900768,0.18633501730852486,1.7249699831008911,-1.5125138759613037

Methods: We studied 12 chronic stroke patients (6 cortical, 6 subcortical lesions) before and after participation in 12 days of constraint-induced movement therapy. Transcranial magnetic Stimulation was applied to test intracortical inhibition (10), intracortical facilitation, silent periods, amplitudes of motor evoked potentials, and motor thresholds. Motor function was assessed by the Motor Activity Log, the Wolf Motor Function Test, and the Modified Ashworth Scale for spasticity. Results: Motor evoked potential amplitudes and motor thresholds were inversely correlated, indicating that both parameters reflect the function of corticospinal pathways. Before therapy, a motor cortex disinhibition was found in the affected hemisphere. This disinhibition was stronger in patients with cortical lesions. The amount of disinhibition was correlated with the degree of spasticity. After therapy, ICI changes were more pronounced in the affected hemisphere compared with the unaffected side. Both ICI decreases and increases were observed. Motor function tests indicated an improvement in all patients. Conclusions: Motor cortical disinhibition is present in chronic stroke patients.

It takes issue with recent articles and books that have assigned major fault to "" the"" gold standard for the disastrous decline of employment, prices, production, income, and welfare that characterized the Great Contraction and the ensuing Great Depression. The Real Bills Doctrine was the guiding principle for passage of The Federal Reserve Act. It proposed that the creation of money would be geared automatically to the output of real goods and services if banks and the central bank adhered to a policy of providing credit only on short-term, self-liquidating loans for legitimate business purposes. The gold standard was to continue as the fundamental determinant of the economy's stock of money, but real bills principles would take care of seasonal and cyclical variations in the demand for money. The new system, however, never operated under a true gold standard. U. S. gold stocks burgeoned after World War I, allowing the quantity-theoretic policies of the New York Fed under Benjamin Strong to fashion a stable price level policy for the monetary system until an authentic gold standard could be become operational. After Strong's death in 1928, real bills advocates on the Fed Board and in some Fed Banks controlled Fed policies. Their avowed purpose was to oversee no monetary expansion until the real economy provided the proper impetus for monetary rejuvenation. In recent decades studies analyzing the Great Contraction have overlooked, first, the fundamental properties of a true gold standard, second, the quantity of gold stocks available for credit expansion by Federal Reserve policies in the early 1930s, third, the statutory power of the Federal Reserve Board to nullify for an indefinite period the gold reserve requirements facing the Federal Reserve Banks, and, fourth, the dominating influence that the Real Bills Doctrine had over both monetary beliefs and monetary policy in that era.

The support for taxi deregulation is preponderant, but not overwhelmingly so. We suggest that the literature favorable to deregulation is richer and broader than the unfavorable literature, which disproportionately is model-building. There is wide consensus that taxi deregulation has been less impressive than advocates had hoped. A very important matter of interpretation is whether the disappointment was due to the over-estimation of what deregulation could deliver, or to deregulation not having been thoroughgoing.
