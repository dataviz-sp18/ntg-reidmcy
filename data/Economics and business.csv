There seems to be a correlation between R&D intensity growth and net sales growth. Despite a competitive total amount of R&D investment, the average overall R&D intensity of the sampled European Union companies is much smaller than for their non-EU counterparts. This is related to a smaller proportion of output from sectors with high intrinsic R&D intensity, which is particularly noticeable in IT Hardware and Software and Computer Set-vices. Although R&D investment amounts are comparable for the biggest firms, the share of R&D performers at the middle and the bottom of the EU-500 Scoreboard is much smaller in the EU than in the non-EU.

While the frequency of production of a product is determined from an existing heuristic, we allow for possible changes in the heuristically computed frequencies of parts (or products) and hence attempt to reduce the total cost per cycle during the metaheuristic search process. Three metaheuristics, namely, a Genetic Algorithm (GA), a Simulated-annealing Algorithm (SA) and an Ant-Colony Algorithm (ACA) are proposed.

In the proposed ACA, the initialisation and updating of pheromone intensity (or trails) are done subject to certain conditions presented in this work. The best-performing existing heuristic algorithm and the proposed algorithms for ELSP with sequence-independent setup times of products are evaluated by considering a couple of benchmark problems and by generating many problems with different number of products and comparing the solutions. In addition, we consider the case of sequence-dependent setup times and the associated setup costs.

MCA cannot be solved in general cases, using a single technique. Therefore, our goal in this research is first to present a new view of the problem and second, to introduce a new idea of using agents' knowledge to partially solve MCA. In this research, an approach that is based on agents' learning histories and knowledge is proposed to solve the MCA problem. Knowledge evaluation-based credit assignment (KEBCA) along with certainty, a measure of agents' knowledge, is developed to judge agents' actions and to assign them proper credits. The proposed KEBCA method is general, however; we study it in some simulated extreme cases in order to gain a better insight into MCA problem and to evaluate our approach in such cases. More specifically, we study the effects of task type (AND-type and OR-type tasks) on solving MCA problem in two cases. In the first case, in addition to the team reinforcement, it is assumed that some extra information at the team level is available. In the second case, such extra information does not exist.

While this approach might work well for activists and highly concerned individuals, it is unlikely ( and rather undesirable) that the average consumer should be outfitted with RFID jamming devices before stepping outside, or that anyone would bother pseudonymizing every can of soda they buy with a personal PIN code. Juels' ""minimalist cryptography"" offers a simple, yet effective, identification and tracking protection based on simple ID rotation, but it requires that the corresponding mappings (i.e., from pseudonyms to real IDs) are electronically exchanged whenever a product changes hands (e.g., for buying a pack of chewing gum at a kiosk)-a rather impractical requirement. Our work extends Juels' concept in order to alleviate the need for passing ID mapping tables. Using carefully assembled sets of IDs based on the cryptographic principle of secret shares, we can create RFID tags that yield virtually no information to casual ""hit-and-run"" attackers, but only reveal their true ID after continuous and undisturbed reading from up-close-something that can hardly go unnoticed by an item's owner.

It was designed more than 50 years ago for a very different world of work. At this stage it has no defenders. The Departments of Defense (DOD) and Homeland Security (DHS) have the authorization to develop their own salary systems. They join a growing list of agencies with similar authority - the Federal Aviation Administration, the Internal Revenue Service, Securities and Exchange Commission, and the General Accountability Office. Each of these agencies has argued that the GS system is an impediment to their efforts to accomplish their mission and achieve their strategic goals. The list will continue to grow. The new model for salary management that has been adopted or proposed in these agencies is based on the broadband concept. Within the bands, pay for performance is the basis for managing salaries. That policy change has been the focus of heated debates. While it is effectively a universal practice for white-collar employees in non-government sectors, it represents a radical and difficult change for public agencies. 1 The new model also makes it necessary to rethink the strategy for aligning salaries with prevailing market pay levels. The locality pay concept adopted under the Federal Employee Pay Comparability Act (FEPCA) was never allowed to operate as planned, and probably has lost too much credibility to be resuscitated.

As women continue to advance into managerial ranks, a closer examination of both supervisor and subordinate gender with regard to harassment consequences is warranted. In this research, we examine with a sample of 130 municipal court clerks whether gender impacts harasser punishment, the degree to which harassers are considered responsible for harassment, and the degree to which the harassment is perceived as serious. The design is a 2x2x2 factorial, with independent variables of harasser (male/female), harassee (male/female), and harassment type (quid pro quo, hostile environment). Contrary to what was hypothesized, men who harassed women were viewed more responsible for the harassment than men who harassed men, while a corresponding difference did not occur for women. Similarly, sexual harassment was viewed most seriously when men harassed women. When it came to administering punishment, however, women who harassed men were given more stringent punishment, providing support for views held by society regarding the appropriateness of men's and women's sexual behavior.

Government emergency planning tends to be conducted by specialized agencies and offices, such as fire departments, police departments or emergency management.

Selectively over the decades, some of this planning was oriented toward insuring that government could continue to function following a disaster. At the federal level during the Cold War, much attention was given to the problem of post-nuclear attack government functioning under the rubric of ""government continuity.""

In spite of sporadic research indicating that local governments are particularly vulnerable, little attention has been paid to planning for government continuity following disasters or terrorism.

Then six key planning measures for insuring post-emergency operations are reviewed. Data are presented from a large southwestern U.S. city on levels of municipal department emergency preparedness.

The aim was to exchange the ponderous control orientation of ""big government"" for the capable flexibility of ""small government.""
