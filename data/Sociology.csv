However, this is not the case for the general multivariate EDF. This paper derives a second-order approximation to the posterior likelihood of a naturally conjugated generalized linear model (GLM), i.e., multivariate EDF subject to a link function (Section 5.5). It is not the same as a normal approximation. It does, however, lead to second-order Bayes estimators of parameters of the posterior. The family of second-order approximations is found to be closed under Bayesian revision. This generates a recursion for repeated Bayesian revision of the GLM with the acquisition of additional data. The recursion simplifies greatly for a canonical link. The resulting structure is easily extended to a filter for estimation of the parameters of a dynamic generalized linear model (DGLM) (Section 6.2). The Kalman filter emerges as a special case. A second type of link function, related to the canonical link, and with similar properties, is identified. This is called here the companion canonical link. For a given GLM with canonical link, the companion to that link generates a companion GLM (Section 4). The recursive form of the Bayesian revision of this GLM is also obtained (Section 5.5.3). There is a perfect parallel between the development of the GLM recursion and its companion. A dictionary for translation between the two is given so that one is readily derived from the other (Table 5.1). The companion canonical link also generates a companion DGLM. A filter for this is obtained (Section 6.3). Section 1.2 provides an indication of how the theory developed here might be applied to loss reserving. A sequel paper, providing numerical illustrations of this, is planned.","Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods",not explicitly computational,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,0,0.8282597475275979,0.3379063755790957,0.7122770547866821,-0.8610665798187256,Computational,Not Computational

It is a flexible class of time series models and provides a flexible way to incorporate full information contained in all autoregressive components with various orders by utilizing the idea of Bayesian averaging or mixing. We adopt a Bayesian sampling scheme based on a weighted Chinese restaurant process for generating partitions of investment returns to estimate the Bayesian infinite mixture time series models. Instead of using the point estimates, as in the classical or non-Bayesian approach, the estimation in this paper is performed by the full Bayesian approach, utilizing the idea of Bayesian averaging to incorporate all information contained in the posterior distributions of the random parameters. This provides a natural way to incorporate model risk or uncertainty. The proposed models can also be used to perform clustering of investment returns and detect outliers of returns. We employ the monthly data from the Toronto Stock Exchange 300 (TSE 300) indices to illustrate the implementation of our models and compare the simulated results from the estimated models with the empirical characteristics of the TSE 300 data. We apply the Bayesian predictive distribution of the logarithmic returns obtained by the Bayesian averaging or mixing to evaluate the quantile-based and conditional tail expectation risk measures for segregated fund contracts via stochastic simulation.

Opening on the ISE follows a non-transparent pre-trading session. We estimate opening returns are 10 per cent more volatile than closing returns. This is significantly smaller compared to other exchanges, such as LSE. The LSE operates under a transparent pre-trading session, which is susceptible to order flow manipulation. We implement an ARMA(1,1) framework to investigate the speed of trader reaction to news. Over-reaction is recorded at the morning auction but is smaller in magnitude when compared to international markets with transparent pre-trading and 'non-binding' orders. The level of price reversal bolsters the over-reaction argument.

A similar balancing act in the Ising (1925) model was found to produce patterns of electron spin alignment, analogous to the soft-assembly of locomotive patterns. The Ising model analog to relative coordination is metastability, and Kelso (1995) hypothesized that metastability is essential to sensorimotor functions across levels and domains of analysis, from individual neurons to neural systems to anatomical components of all kinds. In the present survey, relative coordination and metastability are hypothesized to underlie the soft-assembly of sensorimotor function, and this hypothesis is shown to predict 1/f scaling as a pervasive property of intrinsic fluctuations.

This creates further opportunities for shaping and controlling e-government policy and for more 'experts' to enter the e-government environment, thus increasing the power and influence of the 'consultocracy'.

This paper examines the production of race on the Internet by examining the elements that make up the weblog Freakonomics: the topic, the environment, the medium, and the users. Recent cyberculture research has called for Internet studies to integrate critical theories of race and culture into its analyses. The argument, which this paper seeks to extend, is for the increased recognition of the salience of race in understanding Web content and production. In examining the blog's structure, posts, and comments, I applied Omi and Winant's racial formation theory to the cultural representations and structural phenomena articulated with respect to themes of race, racial interactions, media, and geography. Omi and Winant argue that people interpret the meaning of race by framing it in social structures, and that conversely, recognizing the racial dimensions in social structures leads to interpretations of race. Accordingly, this paper examines interpretations of race in The Wire (a critically-acclaimed minorityled television show), the New York Times news website, the Freakonomics blog, and the Web-enabled audience of the three elements.

This manuscript reports results of an empirical investigation of interpersonal relationships on Last. fm, amusic-based social network site with a multinational user base. In addition to baseline descriptors of relational behavior, the chief goals of this study were to examine the degree to which Last. fm relationships are characterized by homophily (and particularly by shared musical taste), the extent to which communication via Last. fm is associated with other forms of communication (both offline and online), how such communication behavior is associated with demographic and relational characteristics, and whether these variables predict strength of relational development. Results indicate that although Last. fm relational partners exhibit shared musical taste, this shared taste is not associated with relational development. Rather, following media multiplexity theory, relational development is strongly and uniquely associated with communication behavior across almost all forms of communication (including Last. fm). These results suggest that shared interests may foster the creation of weak ties, but conversion of these connections to strong ties is relatively rare.","Sociology,Communication",not explicitly computational,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,True,0,0.9730933989707186,0.13910404029802026,1.738081693649292,-1.8500267267227173,Computational,Not Computational

Through an ethnographic examination of local-level music production and distribution in two American college towns, I demonstrate how musicians cultivate audiences through social capital that is exchanged both on-line and off-line. Active social networking is crucial to their music distribution and promotion. Through digital file sharing and social networking sites, musicians mobilize bonded social capital around their image and music. However, they have difficulty bridging the networks they cultivate with a broader audience, despite their desire to do so. This paper concludes with a sketch of the possibilities for musicians to develop bridging social capital, noting that new media industries capitalize on this desire, turning producers of on-line content into consumers of on-line media content and services. By employing a framework of social networks and social capital, this paper contributes more broadly to sociological understanding of how culture is transmitted through social networks and how social capital is an important resource in the ability to gain recognition for one's cultural expressions in the digital age.","Sociology,Communication",not explicitly computational,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,True,1,0.32449073082322194,0.8082573740760919,-0.4199816584587097,0.3132282495498657,Computational,Computational

Critics of these initiatives generally point at the expected outcome of substantial information imbalances between government and citizens. Clearly, newly formed, ICT-facilitated information relationships between government and citizens would not only need a reorganization of the e-government service domain itself but also a reconsideration of citizens' rights and responsibilities. However, to be able to address these issues adequately, we first need to gain further empirical understanding about what changes are happening to information relationships between citizens and government as a result of the introduction of new forms of IDM in e-government service provision. So far however there is not much empirical knowledge available about what changes are occurring both within and to these flows of information in new e-government service relationships between citizens and government. Accompanying these changes, important questions arise as to how, and to what extent, new forms of IDM have an effect upon what may be called the 'administrative sorting' activities of governments: those classifying processes caused by administrative systems and depending on the values embedded in those systems, which are necessary to the establishment of service relationships with citizens. What, then, are the effects on the citizen of administrative sorting in digitized service relationships, when set against the traditional concept of citizenship? This article reports on empirical findings derived from case study research on new forms of IDM in UK e-government. Moreover it seeks to conceptualize 'administrative sorting' and 'IDM' in e-government service relationships with citizens, also compared to traditional forms of IDM in the 'paper-based era' of public service provision, and explores what the implications are for the citizen and citizenship.","Sociology,Communication",not explicitly computational,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,True,0,0.8445897068029836,0.3285692265463029,0.8092145919799805,-0.8835676908493042,Computational,Not Computational

However, web site design and management implies many choices among various goals, often in reciprocal tension: stressing organizational identity versus opening to the outside; increasing transparency versus reserving some sections to members; informing users versus mobilizing them; widening the debate to people with different opinions versus deepening the discussion in homogeneous groups. In this article, we focus on how the web sites of SMOs are fulfilling Internet potentialities, considering various aspects of their online presence. The empirical research was based on the analysis of 261 web sites of Global Justice Movement (GJM) organizations in six different European countries and at the transnational level. Diverse qualities of SMOs' web sites can be explored empirically, focusing on a series of dimensions such as: information provision, identity building, transparency, I accountability, mobilization, and intervention on the digital divide.

Internet users can simply choose political information that is consistent with their political attitudes. This selectivity in information exposure via the Internet might have serious consequences on the democratic social system, such as fragmentation of shared information and a decrease in political tolerance. Three research questions were empirically investigated as to the presence of selective exposure in political web browsing, the effect of political web browsing on political tolerance, and the contingencies on which selective exposure occurs. Multivariate quantitative analyses show that web browsing, as a form of Internet use for seeking political information, facilitates exposure to arguments that are consistent with one's attitudes, However, selective avoidance, which suppresses exposure to heterogeneous arguments, is not empirically supported. Moreover, although Internet use as a source of infarmation facilitates exposure to homogeneous arguments under certain conditions, it does not have a negative effect in political tolerance. This is because selective exposure to homogeneous arguments takes place if and only if the perceived issue's importance is high. That is, even if selective exposure has an effect on a few issues perceived as highly important, there is no such bias in other less-important issues, which attenuates the effect of selective exposure on the homogeneity of the information environment surrounding each person. It is concluded that the fear of a fragmented society due to selectivity in using the Internet seems to be empirically groundless.","Sociology,Communication",not explicitly computational,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,True,0,0.7860424407613231,0.3707808367230772,0.5316201448440552,-0.7696129679679871,Computational,Not Computational

This paper examines the combination of creative ideas and skills, social learning processes of content creators, management, market and business knowledge that underpin the development new digital media applications and services.

We contend that a salient and central feature of our use of digital technologies is our experience of control, and a more robust understanding of this experience - and whether it is misplaced - is urgently necessary in our contemporary, highly networked society. In answer to this need, we have undertaken a qualitative study into user experiences of control. Our starting conjecture is that the more competent a technology's functional and perceived affordances, the greater the experience of user control. We draw on Rex Hartson's schema of technological affordances, which refer to the way in which technologies allow us to accomplish things in the world. Our findings indicate that Hartson's schema is useful as a starting point for categorizing different experiences of control, but needs to be modified and expanded. In addition to these two types of affordance, findings also indicate that users experience control issues in relation to what we term maintenance affordances, or the need to keep the technology going, and contextual affordances, or the abilities granted by the context of use.","Sociology,Communication",not explicitly computational,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,True,1,0.013440660875369149,0.9983533427782154,-2.198049783706665,2.0978891849517822,Computational,Computational

Future scenarios are projected in which a technology is integrated with society at large and with representations of everyday life. In line with an STS approach, instead of debating the likelihood of possible scenarios, this paper calls for uncovering the values and preferences that are implicitly inbuilt in the visions of the proponents of e-social science. It is only once these are rendered explicit that one can begin to explore the extent to which these values are shared across sections of the research community, or the extent to which they may be specific of certain stakeholders only. The process, it is argued, ultimately allows for a more transparent debate, and a negotiation of which values end up being up-taken in research policy and why.","Sociology,Communication",not explicitly computational,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,True,0,0.9994043808057784,0.021956710030092558,3.6282362937927246,-3.7970769405364986,Computational,Not Computational

The research included 32 interviews with adult mobile phone users, 24-hour communication diaries, and an analysis of respondents' text messages. Many of the text messages collected were short, phatic messages. These distinctive messages exploit the near-synchrony and brevity of SMS. Text messages combine low-contact threshold with immediate direct personal contact; consequently users can send 'thinking of you' messages, creating social connection with negligible effort and disruption. The near-synchrony of SMS also enables a distinctive form of conversation. In SMS conversation, the brevity of messages often creates ambiguity, but asynchrony limits scope for collaborative interpretation, making it harder to clarify meaning. However, instead of treating this as a problem for repair, users sometimes deliberately exploit this, using SMS as an equivocal, open-ended form of communication. The paper ends with a discussion of near-synchrony, contrasting SMS, email and instant messaging, and arguing that the temporal affordances of media are socially shaped and not technologically determined.","Sociology,Communication",not explicitly computational,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,True,1,0.023205969571923626,0.9961825051405908,-1.9388759136199951,1.8009903430938718,Computational,Computational

Here, we exploit his procedure for an analysis of a supply chain replenishment or ordering decision known as the order-up-to policy. We study the discrete-time case and generalize the classical order-up-to policy by the addition of two independent proportional controllers in the policy's feedback loops. The addition of the proportional controllers is well known to allow the order-up-to policy to eliminate the bullwhip problem and we quantify this herein using Jury's inners approach. However, care has to be taken with the use of independent controllers as they can introduce stability problems. This is because the roots of the characteristic equation become complex, and they may even move out of the unit circle in the z-plane. We identify the conditions of stability using Jury's inners approach. We also investigate further the root distribution in the characteristic equation to identify the conditions under which the order-up-to policy is aperiodic. An aperiodic system has only a limited number of maxima and minima in its dynamic response. Thus, aperiodicity is an important characteristic of a supply chain replenishment policy as it will not induce rogue seasonality.","Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods,Management,Operations Research & Management Science",not explicitly computational,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,0,0.9536508462688364,0.17809663243276802,1.4473403692245483,-1.5767542123794556,Computational,Not Computational

The data set consists of the individual demand histories of 753 intermittent line items from the Royal Air Force (UK).

Since HF is a complicated procedure, analytical results are hard to obtain; consequently, most literature is based on simulations and case studies. This paper succeeds in following a more theoretical approach by simplifying the problem: we consider estimation instead of forecasting. So, from a random sample we estimate both the total demand and the fraction of this total that individual items take; multiplying these two quantities gives a new estimate of the individual demand. Then, our research question is: Can aggregation of items, followed by fractioning, lead to more accurate estimates of individual demand? We consider two simple situations that can be analysed fully theoretically. Thirdly, a more practical situation is investigated by means of simulation.","Social Sciences, Mathematical Methods,Management,Operations Research & Management Science",not explicitly computational,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,0,0.8456893133469,0.32703818658222283,0.8119691610336304,-0.8892148733139038,Computational,Not Computational

We show that the performance of the two forecasting strategies is nearly identical, regardless of the coefficient of correlation between the item demands, the items' proportion in the family and the coefficient of the serial correlation term of the demand process.

No such shift occurred. This paper traces the continuity in EU asylum policy's trajectory to the continuity in its 'policy-image': actors seeking to fashion institutional configurations in which they can more effectively assert their preferences can facilitate this institutional change by shifting the 'image' of a policy - in other words, they can highlight new or neglected problems, creating broader pressure for these to be dealt with by new actors in new venues. We disaggregate policy-images into two elements: an element justifying an actor's function in policy-making, and an element justifying the pursuit of its substantive preferences. We argue that institutional change laid down in the Treaty of Amsterdam was facilitated by a policy-image that lacked the latter element. The newly empowered actors have subsequently struggled to assert their substantive preferences despite their institutional upgrade.","Law,Demography",not explicitly computational,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,True,0,0.9648124980577666,0.15738387503685142,1.5975977182388306,-1.713645100593567,Not Computational,Not Computational

The higher propensity for tertiary education among Turks can, to some degree, be explained by their lack of familiarity with the German system of dual vocational training and their educational motivation. Another important finding is that among those who enter higher education students of Turkish origin choose, more often than Germans, academically oriented universities rather than the lower-tier applied science universities.

We test the empirical adequacy of these alternative suggestions using regionalized European Social Survey 2002 and official data which will be analyzed by means of multilevel structural equation modeling. Within regions, our results confirm that perceived group threat increases subsequent immigrant derogation. Likewise, intergroup contact reduces perceived group threat and thereby amends such derogation of immigrants. Between regions, our findings show that a larger size of the immigrant population increases both greater perceived group threat and intergroup contact. At the same time, the effects of perceived group threat and intergroup contact on immigrant derogation resemble those found within regions.
