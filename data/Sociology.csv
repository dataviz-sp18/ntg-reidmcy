Current decision making in the Park is still affected by post socialist relations. In particular, inefficient institutional design and non-robust governance of the resources have resulted in over-exploitation of natural resources and treating common property as open-access. On one hand, evidence emerged on domination of interpersonal trust and failure of institutional design. These were found as barriers for the National Park to be viewed by various actors as an asset. On the other hand, municipal and tourism networks show that cooperation is gradually moving from being externally to internally driven, while displaying characteristics of bottom-up development.

We disaggregate policy-images into two elements: an element justifying an actor's function in policy-making, and an element justifying the pursuit of its substantive preferences. We argue that institutional change laid down in the Treaty of Amsterdam was facilitated by a policy-image that lacked the latter element.

Although, illegal foreign worker phenomenon is a multidisciplinary issue and shall not be eradicated only by the amendments which will take place, but it is still important to highlight the current situation of the Law on Work Permits of Aliens.","Law,Demography",False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,True,0,0.9999885099565252,0.002914149354335209,5.538747787475586,-5.835270404815674

The higher propensity for tertiary education among Turks can, to some degree, be explained by their lack of familiarity with the German system of dual vocational training and their educational motivation. Another important finding is that among those who enter higher education students of Turkish origin choose, more often than Germans, academically oriented universities rather than the lower-tier applied science universities.

We perceive things by interpreting the information of our senses in the light of what we know of our material culture.

Those who design and manufacture objects anticipate how they will be interacted with and how they will fit within the existing material culture. Their intentions are embedded within the form of the objects they produce and are responded to or 'read' during interaction by consumers or users. Material interaction involves pragmatic relations that situate the meaning of objects in relation to other objects and the intentions of the designer and the user. This article attempts to set out the pragmatic features of everyday interaction with objects to enhance sociological understanding of design and consumption and illustrates the processes of material interaction with the examples of making flat-pack furniture and professional work on cars. The concept of 'pragmatics' is derived from the writings of Pierce and Morris and their approach to the study of signs is developed with reference to Barthes. Meaningful material interaction involves the subject/object, person/thing relations of perception and gesture and these are developed from the theories of Merleau-Ponty and Leroi-Gourhan.

The article draws on a reasonably long-standing interest in ethnicity and consumption in marketing studies, and explores the conceptual use of acculturation within this literature. The arguments put forward are framed by recent interdisciplinary studies of the broader relationship between consumption and identity, which stress the importance of contextualizing any influence of ethnic identifications through a wider consideration of other factors including societal status, gender and age, rather than giving it singular treatment. The article uses a body of empirical research drawn from recent oral histories, to explore how these factors informed everyday shopping practices among south Asians in Britain. It examines some of the shopping and wider food provisioning strategies adopted by early immigrants on arrival in Britain. It considers the interaction between the south Asian population and the changing retail structure, in the context of the development of self-service and the supermarket.

However, such feelings are accompanied by doubts and insecurities about the choices to be made, creating a rather dichotomous situation.

The framework addresses the fundamental question of how advertisers use blackness representations to deliver promises about their products' benefits, a necessary first step in ultimately understanding their effectiveness and their impact on blackness itself. The framework orders blackness representations along two dimensions of meaning based on the central claims made in advertisements: (1) claims about the product/brand as a cultural resource, and (2) claims about the viewer that emphasize themes of similarity or difference.

I suggest that the time has come to change the focus of research on blackness representations from numeric representation and role status to understanding their role in promotional strategy more broadly, particularly in branding.","Sociology,Cultural Studies",False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,True,0,0.9987237630608689,0.031589494723286746,3.238453865051269,-3.4241085052490234

This article sets out to explore the meaning production and the identity construction taking place among mature tourists in connection with their holiday consumption. Identity construction is particularly interesting to study in the context of holidays as the physical crossing of borders also marks a mental crossing of borders, away from routines, obligations and scheduled time towards pleasure, free time and 'the good life', and hence holidays are an obvious means of expressing 'who I am'. Mature couples, who are in a phase of transition from full nester to empty nester and from employed individual to retired individual, are the focus. It is investigated in what way mature tourists use holidays as a vehicle of identity construction in their new life situation. In the existing literature, a strong focus is on individual consumers in relation to their creation of identity, and less on the role of identity creation in the gap between individual identity and the larger social groups with which people identify or from which they distinguish themselves. This article examines the locus of identity creation between 'I' and 'they': the 'we'. The study is explorative in its approach. The study shows that mature people use holidays for expressing who they are and, often just as importantly, who they are not. The couple is the central identifying unit and in the process of understanding their couple identity, the mature tourists use other couples and larger sociocultural entities to differentiate themselves from and affiliate with. Individual interests are also identified, but they are often staged as being in the interest of the couple and not just of the individual. Hence, the study demonstrates that the couple is a salient identifying unit in relation to holiday consumption among mature tourists.","Sociology,Cultural Studies",False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,True,0,0.9998681595714572,0.010230588360976092,4.361564636230469,-4.572221755981445

We proposed that contemporary consumerism was built on the back of what we referred to as 'the Fordist Deal'. This deal, pioneered by Henry Ford for his employees, was the promise of ever increasing standards of living in exchange for a quiescent labour force accepting alienating work. Since that deal was struck, consumerism came to signify a general pre-occupation with consumption standards and choice as well as a willingness to read meanings in material commodities and to equate happiness and success with material possessions. In this sense, Ford may be seen as the father both of mass production and mass consumption. Since the Fordist high noon of consumerism in the West, mass consumption is widely seen as having fragmented into a proliferation of highly individualized niche products. For its part, a considerable part of mass production has migrated to countries with lower wages and looser environmental and social controls, fueling their own variants of consumerism. In this article, we examine the gradual erosion of the Fordist Deal in the light of developments in the last 10 years or so, seeking to assess the future of consumerism at a global level. We also seek to identify and discuss some emerging conceptualizations of the consumer, some of the new faces and masks assumed by the archetypal character of our types. We analyse some of the tensions and contradictions lurking behind these conceptualizations and try to envisage some of the real choices facing consumers today and some of the processes of social change that hinge on the outcomes of these choices. The article identifies a fundamental paradox between the ubiquity of the consumer in contemporary discourses and the virtual impossibility of generalizing about consumers. We suggest, then, that the consumer may be viewed as one of those 'essentially contested concepts' proposed by Gallie that defy domestication. The consumer, we argue, is unmanageable, both as a concept, since no-one can pin it down to one specific conceptualization at the expense of all others, and as an entity, since attempts to control and manage the consumer lead to the consumer mutating from one impersonation to another. It is precisely this paradox that we seek to capture in our article's title. The article concludes with a consideration of three basic challenges that are liable to lead to fundamental reorientation of consumption and production, as well as of our conceptualizations and theorizing about them. These challenges are the outcomes of environmental, demographic and social factors that, we argue, make the current situation unsustainable and will bring about its dissolution.","Sociology,Cultural Studies",False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,True,0,0.9799306850263207,0.1207340473497796,1.8825191259384155,-2.0057706832885738

This paper seeks to complicate this thesis, exploring the regulation and rupture of Butler's 'heterosexual matrix' as a complex performative politics through which girls' conflictual relationships with themselves, and other girls and boys are staged and through which dominant versions of tweenage and teenage femininity are reinscribed but also reworked, in race and class specific ways. Drawing on Deleuze and Guattari's powerful conceptual repertoire for disrupting Oedipal logics in Anti-Oedipus, we offer a 'molecular mapping', illustrating cracks and ruptures in what is a porous heterosexual matrix, exploring a rhythm of 'deterritorializations' and 'reterritorializations' of the normative in our respective ethnographic and narrative interviews with girls. We also trace more sustained ruptures of heteronormative femininity drawing upon Deleuze and Guattari's notion of 'lines of flight' and Braidotti's concept of 'alternative figuration'. We argue ruptures and alternative figurations are not constitutive of total 'molar' resistance to norms, but are significant spaces of doing girl differently and crucial to map if we are to perceive the malleability and multiplicity of contemporary girl subjectivities, which exceed heteronormative femininity and phallogocentric desire.",Women's Studies,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,0,0.9999613641976556,0.0053882463556606496,4.943121433258057,-5.218171119689941

This phenomenon is encouraged by open ship registries that legally endorse and affirm the flexibilization of labour at sea. Labour flexibilization processes, however, are not characterized solely by the demand and supply of low wage seafarers. Rather, they are mediated by perceived traits ascribed to seafarers' passport citizenship, physiognomy and biological sex. Men seafarers from countries of the Global North and South, respectively and overwhelmingly dominate the shipboard positions of senior officers and lower level support staff. Women's positioning in this uniquely stratified maritime workforce depends perceptively as well on the association of nationality, race/ethnicity and gender, with that of shipboard work. Thus, although cruise ship crew diversity appears to signify a globalized multicultural workforce and site at sea, seafarer recruitment and shipboard placement according to specific intersections of identity modalities disclose a troubling trend of constructing and affirming the kind of hierarchical identities reminiscent of landbased practices in the past centuries.","Political Science,Women's Studies",False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,True,0,0.999869076485836,0.010292300711465585,4.374621868133545,-4.5661444664001465

Recent work by feminist theorists that begins to bridge this gap looks at gender in isolation from race and class and focuses primarily on the implications of state rescaling for service recipients. By contrast this article focuses on the relationship between state rescaling in post-apartheid South Africa and the restructuring of racialized, gendered social relations in the labour market. Despite policy commitments to 'developmental local government', rescaling of the State South African style is market-oriented and driven by an accommodationist approach to globalization. Drawing on a detailed analysis of the shift to a 'contracting local state' in Johannesburg and the resulting restructuring in the waste management sector, it is argued that this rescaling of the State was shaped by pre-existing racialized gender relations in the workplace and labour market, which it in turn entrenched and exacerbated, infusing these social relations with new content and meaning. Feminist analysis of state rescaling must therefore include analysis of the gendered and racialized social relations within the scales of the workplace, labour market and the local State.","Political Science,Women's Studies",False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,True,0,0.9998370552194116,0.011417713205572048,4.260667324066162,-4.461268901824951

As such, they cannot capture the implications of caring responsibilities, and their use both obscures important aspects of temporal inequality and reinforces the hegemony of male perspectives. This article assesses these arguments, focusing on western democracies and using childcare in the UK as a case study. It finds that some time-use research has indeed misrepresented the extent and nature of continuing temporal inequalities.

Recent discursive shifts, however, combined with the changing architecture of the state and a women's movement largely in abeyance, have resulted in the 'fall of the femocrat' and increasing marginalization of feminist agendas.
