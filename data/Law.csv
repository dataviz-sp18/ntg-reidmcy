Nevertheless, a pair of recent cases involving multiple parties has created yet another inter-circuit conflict, and has thrust the lawful means requirement to the forefront of the inevitable discovery debate. The First Circuit has allowed the prosecution to rely on an illegal search of a third party in order to invoke the inevitable discovery doctrine against the relevant defendant, seizing on the Supreme Court's prohibition against vicarious exclusionary challenges.

Town of Castle Rock v. Gonzales, which holds that there is no constitutional right guaranteeing that police will enforce restraining orders, highlights a disjunction between the legal reality, which is rooted in law enforcement's discretion, and the social reality, where intimate partners are perpetrating acts of violence because restraining orders afford victims little protection. According to Castle Rock, even statutes that seemingly mandate abuser arrests may still allow police officers significant discretion to determine how, when, and if they need to respond to victims' requests for restraining order enforcement. Further, a 2005 report from the California Attorney General's Office detailed significant system-wide failures in the judicial and executive branches' protection of domestic violence victims and prosecution of perpetrators. The report showed that the government's failure to enforce restraining orders and take domestic violence threats seriously is a problem not just confined to the facts of Castle Rock. This Note examines Castle Rock, its holding, and the California Attorney General's Report, ultimately concluding that systemic changes should be made to afford greater protections to domestic violence victims. Specifically, this Note advocates a better-coordinated national database to archive the issuance of restraining orders and domestic violence convictions. Such a repository would allow law enforcement officials to track domestic violence more effectively. Further, this Note suggests that state legislatures reevaluate mandatory arrest statutes to eliminate potential ambiguities where the legislature intended to eliminate law enforcement discretion. Finally, this Note suggests changing prosecutorial and judicial structures to create more specialization and awareness, and allow victims easier access to resources.

Hendricks, the Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of state statutes that allow for the civil commitment of ""sexually violent predators"" after completion of their criminal sentences. But the Court in Hendricks left uncertain the precise requirements demanded by substantive due process in this context. Specifically, questions remained regarding whether, and to what degree, a defendant must suffer from volitional inability for the commitment to pass constitutional muster. The Supreme Court responded five years later in Kansas v. Crane, where it held that ""there must be proof of serious difficulty in controlling behavior."" This could have been considered the end of the debate over whether the Constitution requires a finding of serious volitional inability for the civil commitment of sex offenders. However, most state courts which have subsequently considered the issue with respect to their sexually violent predator statute refuse to mandate such a finding. Part I of this Note analyzes the recent Florida Supreme Court decision State v. White, the latest in a line of state court decisions that essentially interpret around the Crane volitional requirement. This analysis demonstrates how the reasoning employed in White and similar decisions is irreconcilable with the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling in Crane. Part II discusses state court institutional schemes and explores the possibility that majoritarian political pressures resulting from these schemes could be playing a role in the state judicial analyses of sexually violent predator laws against federal substantive due process standards.

We disaggregate policy-images into two elements: an element justifying an actor's function in policy-making, and an element justifying the pursuit of its substantive preferences. We argue that institutional change laid down in the Treaty of Amsterdam was facilitated by a policy-image that lacked the latter element.

In doing so, it seeks to identify the central changes which Would need to be made if private actions are to play a more significant role in the competition regime. Contrary to recent statements made by the European Commission, the paper argues that any changes made must recognize that private actions perform a dual function in EC competition law: they not only compensate those who have been harmed by anticompetitive behavior but also contribute to the overall level of deterrence generated by the competition regime. Going further, it argues that whilst increased deterrence and compensation almost always go hand in hand, the primary objective of private actions is to Support effective competition enforcement. Building on this, the paper identifies and examines the main pillars of any effective reform program in Europe: enhancing the role of collective actions, clarifying the issues surrounding indirect purchasers' standing and passing-on, and ensuring, as far as possible, that public and private enforcement operate in harmony-where they clash, the paper argues that the former must take precedence over the latter. In light of this discussion, the paper goes on to assess the proposals made by the European Commission (""Commission"") and the U.K. Office of Fair Trading (""OFT"") for reform of the system. It Concludes that the proposals made, if implemented, would appreciably increase the incentives of businesses to comply with the EC competition rules while at the same time achieving higher levels of compensation.

The first, which we call ""extraction,"" is conduct engaged in by the firm to capture Surplus from what the firm has created independently of the conduct's effect on rivals. The second, which we call ""extension,"" is single-firm conduct that increases the firm's profit by weakening or eliminating the competitive constraints provided by rivals' products. We propose, as a fundamental antitrust policy towards single-firm conduct, the following: Conduct merely to extract Surplus the firm has created independently of the conduct's effect on rivals should be permitted. Conversely, conduct that extends the firm's market power by impairing the competitive constraints imposed by rivals presents a legitimate cause for concern.

We rely on detailed case-level data on defense legal fees and expenses, and Texas state bar data on lawyers' hourly rates. We study medical malpractice (""med mal"") cases in detail, and other types of cases in less detail. Controlling for payouts, real defense costs in med mal cases rise by 4.6 percent per year, roughly doubling over this period. The rate of increase is similar for legal fees and for other expenses. Real hourly rates for personal injury defense counsel are flat. Defense costs in med mal cases correlate strongly with payouts, both in ordinary least squares (OLS) and in an instrumental variable analysis. They also correlate with the stage at which a case is resolved, and case duration. Mean duration declined over time. Med mal insurers predominantly use outside counsel. Case-level variation in initial expense reserves predicts a small fraction of actual defense costs. In other areas of tort litigation (auto, general commercial, multi-peril, and other professional liability), defense costs rose by 2.2 percent per year. Defense costs in these cases are predicted by the same factors as in med mal cases, plus the presence of multiple defendants. Insurer reserving practices raise some puzzles. Med mal insurers did not react to the sustained rise in defense costs by adjusting their expense reserves, either in real dollars or relative to reserves for payouts. Thus, expense reserves declined substantially relative to defense costs. In other litigation areas, expense reserves rose along with defense costs.","Law,Economics",False,True,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,0,0.9999999757054396,0.00017542446304172322,8.884886741638184,-8.648126602172853

This article addresses these questions by reviewing evidence from a study that interviewed offenders subject to electronically monitored curfew orders. It suggests that for some offenders curfew orders reduce offending and contribute to desistance by addressing levels of social capital in two ways. First, by decreasing levels of anti-social capital by reducing offenders' links with situations, people, places and networks correlated with their offending. Second, by improving levels of pro-social capital by encouraging offenders to connect or re-connect with influences linked with desistance such as family and employment. Curfew orders can also have negative impacts on pro-social capital particularly by disrupting employment and family ties and responsibilities.

The findings show that in both cities (1) young people's self-reported violent behaviour is predicted by crime propensity and lifestyle, and their interaction, and (2) a substantial proportion (40 percent) of the difference in the level of violence vanishes when taking into account national differences in young people's crime propensity and lifestyles.
