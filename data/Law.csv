Courts and legislatures have struggled to find a balance between encouraging innovation in software development and avoiding undesirable digital information monopolies. Although neither the patent nor the copyright system has provided a particularly satisfactory paradigm for software protection, copyright arguably creates more insidious undercurrents in today's marketplace. If lawmakers do not act expeditiously to stem the tide of copyright protection, the software industry could be facing an intellectual property grab of great proportions which might ultimately impede innovations in software development. This Article argues for a shifting of the paradigms employed for software protection. In particular, copyright law should be scaled back and, to the extent it is retained, the doctrines of merger and scenes a faire should be more clearly developed to avoid unjustifiable information monopolies and questionable market practices.

Currently, some thirty million people regularly play such games and the number is growing. Exploring the reach of the Tax Code into virtual world transactions not only responds to the potentially practical needs of millions of U.S. taxpayers, it also permits a re-evaluation of core principles of income tax as they interplay with life activities in the context of twenty-first century American culture. This Article's central thesis is that while player activity in virtual worlds undoubtedly produces measurable economic value to the player, player activity that occurs solely within the online virtual world is not gross income under the law. The Article argues for a ""cash out"" rule. Players whose added wealth consists solely in ""units of play"" should not be taxed unless and until they convert those units into cash or property that is something other than a unit of play. Conversely, when the play ceases, taxation begins. The resulting line-drawing difficulties have nothing to do with player intent nor with ""fun"" and ""games.""

In fact, Rule 34(h) requires the production of information in an objectively reasonably accessible format.

In essence, hotspot mapping is used as a basic form of crime prediction, relying on retrospective data to identify the areas of high concentrations of crime and where policing and other crime reduction resources should be deployed. A number of different mapping techniques are used for identifying hotspots of crime-point mapping, thematic mapping of geographic areas (e. g. Census areas), spatial ellipses, grid thematic mapping and kernel density estimation (KDE). Several research studies have discussed the use of these methods for identifying hotspots of crime, usually based on their ease of use and ability to spatially interpret the location, size, shape and orientation of clusters of crime incidents. Yet surprising, very little research has compared how hotspot mapping techniques can accurately predict where crimes will occur in the future. This research uses crime data for a period before a fixed date (that has already passed) to generate hotspot maps, and test their accuracy for predicting where crimes will occur next. Hotspot mapping accuracy is compared in relation to the mapping technique that is used to identify concentrations of crime events (thematic mapping of Census Output Areas, spatial ellipses, grid thematic mapping, and KDE) and by crime type-four crime types are compared (burglary, street crime, theft from vehicles and theft of vehicles). The results from this research indicate that crime hotspot mapping prediction abilities differ between the different techniques and differ by crime type. KDE was the technique that consistently outperformed the others, while street crime hotspot maps were consistently better at predicting where future street crime would occur when compared to results for the hotspot maps of different crime types. The research offers the opportunity to benchmark comparative research of other techniques and other crime types, including comparisons between advanced spatial analysis techniques and prediction mapping methods. Understanding how hotspot mapping can predict spatial patterns of crime and how different mapping methods compare will help to better inform their application in practice.

The final output is text descriptions that not only describe, in human-readable terms, what is happening but also explain the interactions that take place. The input to the reasoning process is the information obtained from video processing methods that provide an abstraction from the image data to qualitative (i.e. human-readable) descriptions of observed human activity.

Using the bootstrap resampling method, we developed a simple probability model trained with an anomaly-free training sample and yielded a receiver operating characteristic area of 0.96, specificity of 0.96, sensitivity of 0.96, and a classification agreement rate of 0.96 to detect abnormal events in a testing sample.

Numerical analysis is mainly concerned with the accuracy and stability of numerical algorithms. We frame these concerns in terms of forward and backward error, two important concepts in helping understand the quality of the computed answers. The goal of numerical computing is to obtain correct, approximate answers to the true solution. We extended this forward and backward error framework to issues in least squares problems and check the condition of the regression problem via condition numbers.

I focus on three issues that raise antitrust and competition policy concerns. First, the agreement calls for Google to act as agent for rightsholders in setting the price of online access to consumers. Google is tasked with developing a pricing algorithm that will maximize revenues for each of those works. Direct competition among rightsholders would push prices towards some measure of costs and would not be designed to maximize revenues. The consumer access pricing provision might very well fail a challenge under Section 1 of the Sherman Act. Second, and much more centrally to the settlement agreement, the opt-out class action will make it possible for Google to include orphan works in its book search service. Orphan works are works as to which the rightsholder cannot be identified or found. The opt-out class action is the vehicle for large-scale collective action by active rightsholders. Active rightsholders have little incentive to compete with themselves by granting multiple licenses of their works or of the orphan works. Plus under the terms of the settlement agreement, active rightsholders benefit directly from the revenues attributable to orphan works used in GBS. We can mitigate the market power that will otherwise arise through the settlement by expanding the number of rights licenses available under the settlement agreement. To do that, we should take the step of unbundling the orphan works deal from the overall settlement agreement and create a separate license to use those works. All of that will undoubtedly add more complexity to what is already a large piece of work, and it may make sense to push out the new licenses to the future. That would mean ensuring now that the court retains jurisdiction to do that and/or giving the new registry created in the settlement the power to do this sort of licensing. Third, there is a risk that approval by the court of the settlement could cause antitrust immunities to attach to the arrangements created by the settlement agreement. As it is highly unlikely that the fairness hearing will undertake a meaningful antitrust analysis of those arrangements, if the district court approves the settlement, the court should include a clause-call this a no Noerr clause-in the order approving the settlement providing that no antitrust immunities attach from the court's approval.","Law,Economics",not explicitly computational,True,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,0,0.9999995988905432,0.000665902143885955,7.4153289794921875,-7.31370210647583,Computational,Not Computational

Consumers reveal personal information through the use of keywords and through their online behavior. Advertisers reveal company information by bidding on positions on the search page. Search firms employ information to match buyers with sellers more effectively and to increase earnings from advertising.

However, contrary to some claims, merger simulation models do not allow investigators to avoid much of the competitive effects analysis relating to the relevant economic market, nor do they necessarily provide more precision to merger control. Without understanding the limitations of such models and the circumstances under which they can and should be usefully applied, they may not just be useless, but dangerous in the sense of providing possibly spurious results with spurious claimed accuracy. This paper argues that any merger simulation models used should be ""bespoke"" models, rather than off-the-shelf models, but cautions that even bespoke models will frequently not be as useful as is often claimed. This is not to deny that there are occasions when well-constructed bespoke models are genuinely useful and do offer genuine improvements in merger control.","Law,Economics",not explicitly computational,True,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,0,0.9999959518357532,0.002131118049829335,6.268263816833496,-6.148979187011719,Computational,Not Computational

Unfortunately, each access requirement is governed by a separate set of rules for determining both the scope and the price of access. The resulting ad hoc regime has created difficult definitional problems and opportunities for regulatory arbitrage. In this article we propose a system inspired by the discipline of mathematics known as graph theory that integrates all of the different forms of access into a single analytical framework. This system separates different access regimes into five categories: (1) retail access, (2) wholesale access, (3) interconnection access, (4) platform access, and (5) unbundled access. It also provides insights into how each type of access complicates the already difficult problems of network configuration and management and introduces inefficient biases into decisions about network capacity and design. The approach we propose also provides insights into the transaction cost implications of the different types of access. Drawing on the Coasean theory of the firm, our approach examines the tradeoffs between internal governance costs and the external transaction costs of providing access to offer a theory of network boundaries. This framework shows how access regulation distorts networks' natural boundaries and provides a basis for evaluating whether private ordering through markets would lead to more efficient network design.","Law,Economics",not explicitly computational,True,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,1,0.00469565040965556,0.9996475156439979,-2.767378807067871,2.5890331268310547,Computational,Computational

Because of the trend to deliver traditional telecommunications services, as well as new forms of content and applications, by Internet protocol (IP), a regime of network neutrality regulation would displace or subordinate a substantial portion of existing telecommunications regulation. If the United States adopts network neutrality regulation, other industrialized nations probably will soon follow. As a result of their investment to create next-generation broadband networks, network operators have the ability to innovate inside the network by offering both senders and receivers of information greater bandwidth and prioritization of delivery. Network neutrality regulation would, among other things, prevent providers of broadband Internet access service (such as digital subscriber line (DSL) or cable modem service) from offering a guaranteed, expedited delivery speed in return for the payment of a fee. The practical effect of banning such differential pricing (called ""access tiering"" by its critics) would be to prevent the pricing of access to content or applications providers according to priority of delivery. To the extent that an advertiser of a good or service would be willing to contract with a network operator for advertising space on the network operator's affiliated content, another practical effect of network neutrality regulation would be to erect a barrier to vertical integration of network operators into advertising-based business models that could supplement or replace revenues earned from their existing usage-based business models. Moreover, by making end-users pay for the full cost of broadband access, network neutrality regulation would deny broadband access to the large number of consumers who would not be able to afford, or who would not have a willingness to pay for, what would otherwise be less expensive access. For example, Google is planning to offer broadband access to end-users for free in San Francisco by charging other content providers for advertising. This product offering is evidently predicated on the belief that many end-users demand discounted or free broadband access that is paid for by parties other than themselves. Proponents of network neutrality regulation argue that such restrictions on the pricing policies of network operators are necessary to preserve innovation on the edges of the network, as opposed to innovation within the network. However, recognizing that network congestion and real-time applications demand some differential pricing according to bandwidth or priority, proponents of network neutrality regulation would allow broadband Internet access providers to charge higher prices to end-users (but not content or applications providers) who consume more bandwidth or who seek priority delivery of certain traffic.

A quick comparison of two Internet advertising mergers from different stages of the Internet's existence demonstrates two things. First, as the novelty of the Internet wears off, online merger analysis looks increasingly like offline merger analysis. Second, most of the things that make online mergers interesting have little to do with competition law.","Law,Economics",not explicitly computational,True,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,0,0.9999948182471841,0.0024334822714684365,6.154361248016357,-6.016000747680664,Computational,Not Computational

Recent research has found that MSPs are significant in many industries and that some standard economic results-such as the Lerner Index-do not apply to them, in material ways, without some significant modification to take linkages between the multiple sides into account. This article extends several key tools used for the analysis of mergers to situations in which one or more of the suppliers are MSPs. It shows that the application of traditional tools to mergers involving MSPs results in biases, the direction of which depends on the particular tool being used and other conditions. It also extends these tools to the analysis of the merger of MSPs.

Due to the presence of network effects, advocates warn that consumers may fail to adopt the best technology, thus missing out on potential benefits. Even worse, consumers may split, adopting multiple technologies and thus missing out on the benefits of network effects. Due to coordination problems, consumers cannot mitigate the effects of bad technology choices and the economy becomes stuck with inferior innovations. This article demonstrates that consumer coordination solves the underlying network effects problem, thus eliminating technology lock-in. Network effects are confined at most to the information and communications technology and selected electronics industries, which have developed mechanisms for interconnection and interoperability. Firms have incentives to provide interconnection and interoperability when it is efficient to do so. Rapid technological innovation is apparent whereas technology lock-in is a rare phenomenon.

A total of 165 participants were exposed to an unfamiliar voice, either directly recorded or mobile phone recorded, for 40 seconds. After a two week delay, they were asked to identify the target-voice in a 7 voice target-present line-up. We used a between-subjects design, where half of the subjects were exposed to a directly recorded line-up, and the other half to a mobile phone recorded line-up. Data analysis did not show any significant effect of presentation format or line-up format. These results suggest that the detrimental effect on voice recognition suggested by the poorer sound quality of mobile phone recordings is minimal. They also indicate that there is no benefit from conducting a mobile phone recorded line-up, if the voice is originally heard over a mobile phone. More research is needed, however, before definitive conclusions may be drawn. The overall accuracy for correct identifications was 12.7% which is expected by chance. Further, one particular foil attracted 54% of all false identifications.

In the Google Book Settlement Agreement, this new kind of usage is referred to as 'non-display uses' of digital works.

The model is intended to provide both technical and non-technical investigative resources, covering mainstream law enforcement, partner agencies and specialist technical services, with a formal and common structure when investigating the complex technical nature of cybercrime. Finally, the model is further aimed at providing cybercrime investigators with a means to consolidate understanding, share knowledge and communicate the resulting outcomes as an investigation moves through each relevant stage.

In the process, due consideration will be given to both public and private interests, with the former taking precedence; while the recommended solutions will be made within the currently outdated framework for Internet intermediary protection (i.e. safe harbor laws) and exceptions (i.e. specific statutory exemptions and the general fair use defense) under the existing copyright regime. Thus, the proposed changes will be far reaching without being too radical a departure from current law, an evolution that will likely be more acceptable and realistic a solution to the problem. This paper is published in two parts. Part One of this paper will deal with the challenges to the copyright regime posed by the operations and technology behind the Google Images Search Engine, while Part Two that will be published in the subsequent edition of the CLSR will assess the benefits of the Google Books Search Project vis-a-vis the effects it will have on the scope of copyright protection. Recommendations are made to copyright law to accommodate both functions while generally preserving the main objectives of copyright protection. (C) 2011 Warren B. Chik. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

In this contribution, the term ICT Crime is analysed from both a practical and theoretical legal perspective. It will be argued that it is very difficult if not impossible to define ICT Crime unequivocally. Furthermore, there seems to be insufficient grounds to see ICT criminality as an autonomous legal discipline, as an independent functional discipline or as a specialisation. An important reason for dealing with ICT Crime as if it is a problem area seems to be fear in governmental organisations that new technology could lead to forms of criminality that are outside their reach of control. Furthermore, the application of ICT has led to a reorientation of legal powers with respect to investigation and prosecution. However, these subjects should be dealt with at an international level.

Williams, the Supreme Court adopted the inevitable discovery exception to the exclusionary rule, which admits illegally-obtained evidence if the prosecution can establish that the evidence would have been discovered by lawful means. Despite ongoing criticism and divided application of the nuances of the inevitable discovery doctrine, the requirement that the hypothetical independent source be ""lawful"" is one element that appears straightforward. Nevertheless, a pair of recent cases involving multiple parties has created yet another inter-circuit conflict, and has thrust the lawful means requirement to the forefront of the inevitable discovery debate. The First Circuit has allowed the prosecution to rely on an illegal search of a third party in order to invoke the inevitable discovery doctrine against the relevant defendant, seizing on the Supreme Court's prohibition against vicarious exclusionary challenges. On the other hand, Judge Richard Posner, writing for the Seventh Circuit, has refused to allow the prosecution to rely on unlawful means, effectively interpreting the lawful means requirement as ""lawful to the world."" This Note asserts that Judge Posner's interpretation of the lawful means requirement of the inevitable discovery doctrine must be the correct one from the standpoint of justice. And while Judge Posner's analogy to concurrent causation in tort law is instructive, it is also subject to criticism. The better analogy is illustrated by the majority and minority conceptions of duty in negligence law, laid out in the seminal tort case, Palsgraf v. Long Island Railroad Company.

Gonzales,Journal,Article,2006.0,12.0,English,"Despite systemic reforms during the late twentieth century, domestic violence victims still face a troubling threat from their abusers. Town of Castle Rock v. Gonzales, which holds that there is no constitutional right guaranteeing that police will enforce restraining orders, highlights a disjunction between the legal reality, which is rooted in law enforcement's discretion, and the social reality, where intimate partners are perpetrating acts of violence because restraining orders afford victims little protection. According to Castle Rock, even statutes that seemingly mandate abuser arrests may still allow police officers significant discretion to determine how, when, and if they need to respond to victims' requests for restraining order enforcement. Further, a 2005 report from the California Attorney General's Office detailed significant system-wide failures in the judicial and executive branches' protection of domestic violence victims and prosecution of perpetrators. The report showed that the government's failure to enforce restraining orders and take domestic violence threats seriously is a problem not just confined to the facts of Castle Rock. This Note examines Castle Rock, its holding, and the California Attorney General's Report, ultimately concluding that systemic changes should be made to afford greater protections to domestic violence victims. Specifically, this Note advocates a better-coordinated national database to archive the issuance of restraining orders and domestic violence convictions. Such a repository would allow law enforcement officials to track domestic violence more effectively. Further, this Note suggests that state legislatures reevaluate mandatory arrest statutes to eliminate potential ambiguities where the legislature intended to eliminate law enforcement discretion. Finally, this Note suggests changing prosecutorial and judicial structures to create more specialization and awareness, and allow victims easier access to resources.

Hendricks, the Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of state statutes that allow for the civil commitment of ""sexually violent predators"" after completion of their criminal sentences. But the Court in Hendricks left uncertain the precise requirements demanded by substantive due process in this context. Specifically, questions remained regarding whether, and to what degree, a defendant must suffer from volitional inability for the commitment to pass constitutional muster. The Supreme Court responded five years later in Kansas v. Crane, where it held that ""there must be proof of serious difficulty in controlling behavior."" This could have been considered the end of the debate over whether the Constitution requires a finding of serious volitional inability for the civil commitment of sex offenders. However, most state courts which have subsequently considered the issue with respect to their sexually violent predator statute refuse to mandate such a finding. Part I of this Note analyzes the recent Florida Supreme Court decision State v. White, the latest in a line of state court decisions that essentially interpret around the Crane volitional requirement. This analysis demonstrates how the reasoning employed in White and similar decisions is irreconcilable with the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling in Crane. Part II discusses state court institutional schemes and explores the possibility that majoritarian political pressures resulting from these schemes could be playing a role in the state judicial analyses of sexually violent predator laws against federal substantive due process standards.

This paper traces the continuity in EU asylum policy's trajectory to the continuity in its 'policy-image': actors seeking to fashion institutional configurations in which they can more effectively assert their preferences can facilitate this institutional change by shifting the 'image' of a policy - in other words, they can highlight new or neglected problems, creating broader pressure for these to be dealt with by new actors in new venues. We disaggregate policy-images into two elements: an element justifying an actor's function in policy-making, and an element justifying the pursuit of its substantive preferences. We argue that institutional change laid down in the Treaty of Amsterdam was facilitated by a policy-image that lacked the latter element.

In doing so, it seeks to identify the central changes which Would need to be made if private actions are to play a more significant role in the competition regime. Contrary to recent statements made by the European Commission, the paper argues that any changes made must recognize that private actions perform a dual function in EC competition law: they not only compensate those who have been harmed by anticompetitive behavior but also contribute to the overall level of deterrence generated by the competition regime. Going further, it argues that whilst increased deterrence and compensation almost always go hand in hand, the primary objective of private actions is to Support effective competition enforcement. Building on this, the paper identifies and examines the main pillars of any effective reform program in Europe: enhancing the role of collective actions, clarifying the issues surrounding indirect purchasers' standing and passing-on, and ensuring, as far as possible, that public and private enforcement operate in harmony-where they clash, the paper argues that the former must take precedence over the latter.

This endless process displaced older technologies in order to make way for new ones, but led to economic growth far greater than more stable, conservative alternatives.' Schumpeter's vision was striking-in sharp contrast with the conventional neoclassical model of competitive markets, where the focus was on changes in output and price, relatively leisurely shifts in Consumer tastes, and exceptional strategic behavior that occasionally dislodged one technology and displaced it by another.

The first, which we call ""extraction,"" is conduct engaged in by the firm to capture Surplus from what the firm has created independently of the conduct's effect on rivals. The second, which we call ""extension,"" is single-firm conduct that increases the firm's profit by weakening or eliminating the competitive constraints provided by rivals' products. We propose, as a fundamental antitrust policy towards single-firm conduct, the following: Conduct merely to extract Surplus the firm has created independently of the conduct's effect on rivals should be permitted. Conversely, conduct that extends the firm's market power by impairing the competitive constraints imposed by rivals presents a legitimate cause for concern. An essential element of appropriate antitrust Policy is to allow a firm to capture as much of the surplus that, by its own investment, innovation, industry, or foresight, the firm has itself brought into existence. Alternative policy approaches to single-firm conduct including, in particular, ones aiming to enhance static efficiency at the possible cost of dynamic efficiency and ones seeking to maximize overall welfare through more targeted intervention on a case-by-case basis (not to mention the use of competition policy to protect competitors rather than consumers) seriously threaten to impede economic growth and welfare over time. A policy that goes further, and which permits all unilateral conduct regardless of competitive effects (perhaps on grounds that ""even more profit will generate even more innovation"") is considered and rejected as overly lenient, inconsistent with widely accepted presumptions in favor of inter-firm competition, and Unwise-at least under the Current state of economic knowledge.",Law,not explicitly computational,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,0,0.9999814400320406,0.004644395551840214,5.527027606964111,-5.367457389831543,Not Computational,Not Computational

The results indicate that, at some point in the voting process, management obtains highly accurate information about the likely voting outcome and, based on that information, acts to influence the vote.

We rely on detailed case-level data on defense legal fees and expenses, and Texas state bar data on lawyers' hourly rates. We study medical malpractice (""med mal"") cases in detail, and other types of cases in less detail. Controlling for payouts, real defense costs in med mal cases rise by 4.6 percent per year, roughly doubling over this period. The rate of increase is similar for legal fees and for other expenses. Real hourly rates for personal injury defense counsel are flat. Defense costs in med mal cases correlate strongly with payouts, both in ordinary least squares (OLS) and in an instrumental variable analysis. They also correlate with the stage at which a case is resolved, and case duration. Mean duration declined over time. Med mal insurers predominantly use outside counsel. Case-level variation in initial expense reserves predicts a small fraction of actual defense costs. In other areas of tort litigation (auto, general commercial, multi-peril, and other professional liability), defense costs rose by 2.2 percent per year. Defense costs in these cases are predicted by the same factors as in med mal cases, plus the presence of multiple defendants. Insurer reserving practices raise some puzzles. Med mal insurers did not react to the sustained rise in defense costs by adjusting their expense reserves, either in real dollars or relative to reserves for payouts. Thus, expense reserves declined substantially relative to defense costs. In other litigation areas, expense reserves rose along with defense costs.","Law,Economics",not explicitly computational,True,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,0,0.9999999757054396,0.00017542446304172322,8.884886741638184,-8.648126602172853,Not Computational,Not Computational

This article addresses these questions by reviewing evidence from a study that interviewed offenders subject to electronically monitored curfew orders. It suggests that for some offenders curfew orders reduce offending and contribute to desistance by addressing levels of social capital in two ways. First, by decreasing levels of anti-social capital by reducing offenders' links with situations, people, places and networks correlated with their offending. Second, by improving levels of pro-social capital by encouraging offenders to connect or re-connect with influences linked with desistance such as family and employment. Curfew orders can also have negative impacts on pro-social capital particularly by disrupting employment and family ties and responsibilities.

In this article we expand the reach of existing research by exploring levels and patterns of recidivism in uncharted territory-the Republic of Ireland-and by drawing out the implications of the patterns observed there for comparative analysis.",Criminology & Penology,not explicitly computational,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,0,0.9999998417891504,0.0004339927760041081,7.917288303375244,-7.742048740386963,Not Computational,Not Computational

Most of the published research has been published in the USA and relates to the street-level drugs economy. In this project, 50 sentenced adult women were interviewed in an English prison about their criminal involvement with co-defendants. The picture that emerged revealed the widespread use of devices by males ranging from various forms of manipulation to direct physical coercion in order to ensure female compliance with their criminal activities. These findings stand in contrast to statements in some of the more recent literature, which seek to emphasize women's agency in their offending behaviour.

This article claims that the restorative movement is experiencing a tension between normative abolitionist and pragmatic visions of restorative justice. It proceeds to identify six conceptual fault-lines that characterize this tension. These do not only refer to various definitional positions, but also disagreements that negatively affect both the theoretical and practical development of restorative justice. These tensions also encourage a power-interest battle between different stakeholders within the restorative movement including practitioners, theoreticians, researchers and policy makers. To approach these controversies, there needs to be an acknowledgment of the multidimensional nature of the conceptual problem of restorative justice and the impact it has on its application. The article attempts to get to grips with this problem, and provide a common ground for the future development of restorative justice.",Criminology & Penology,not explicitly computational,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,0,0.9999999939575808,8.701580608509537e-05,9.575127601623537,-9.34933376312256,Not Computational,Not Computational

Employing the legitimacy scale developed by Sunshine and Tyler, this study sought to fill this gap in our criminological knowledge using data from a representative public survey in Accra, Ghana (N = 374). The article reports a lack of reliability, in the Ghanaian context, for the overall Sunshine-Tyler scale, and therefore focuses attention on a sub-scale labelled 'perceptions of police trustworthiness'. The findings show that though perceptions of police effectiveness exercise a direct impact on perceived police trustworthiness, the relationship is stronger if the police are also perceived to be procedurally fair. The findings are significant as they show that building public trust in the police requires democratic reforms that simultaneously improve the capacity of the police to achieve both substantive effectiveness and procedural fairness.",Criminology & Penology,not explicitly computational,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,0,0.9999999902665242,0.00011234385412442814,9.353860855102539,-9.093833923339844,Not Computational,Not Computational
