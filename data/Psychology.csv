The relationship between the components is always overlooked which implies little knowledge on developmental pathways and possible causal relations between components over these paths. This research focused on the possible coupling among components. Fundamental movement patterns may arise by the coupling of different components, the strength of which being conditioned by the individual's developmental status. Mature individuals may show strong coupling among components which would be weak in novice individuals. Thirty-one children aged 4 to 5 years old had to throw a tennis ball as far as possible in a field. Their behaviour was videotaped and later analysed according to the Roberton's model of component analysis. The descriptive analysis depicted the frequency of developmental steps per component, the percentage of the children who showed variable behaviour in one or more components, the interaction between components' developmental steps from the comparison of the mode of developmental steps showed by each individual. As expected becoming skilled was associated with the strengthening of coupling among components. Arm preparation was the component highly correlated to the others suggesting a role as control parameter in development which is contrast with the literature that indicates such role for trunk rotation.

This would help control the programming for TV coverage in both indoor and outdoor volleyball. In this research the duration of 1147 matches were recorded from 19 tournaments of Beach Volley World Tour organised by the FIVB.

However, in FIVB2001, the winner was decided in two winning sets. The teams were divided into two sub-groups depending on the final score (RS2-0 and RS2-1). The one way ANOVA indicated that there were significant differences (F-(3.1689) = 124.307 p< 0.001) in total duration time of matches between the tournaments.

The purpose of this study was therefore to describe, for the first time, the heart rate (HR) responses of referees during rugby union matches in the English Premiership. Thirteen 'elite' referees (ranked in the top 20 referees in England, aged 34-51 years) had their HR recorded by telemetry during 1-4 matches. Within 2-3 weeks of these measurements they also completed a laboratory-based physiological assessment of their HR, (V) over dot o(2) and blood lactate responses to incremental treadmill exercise. The mean +/- SD HR of the referees during match play was 153 +/- 9b.min(-1) (equivalent to 84 +/- 5% of HR max). It was estimated from the individual regression equations of HR on (V) over dot O-2 derived from the incremental treadmill tests that the mean (V) over dot O-2 during match play was 3.17+/-0.40L.min(-1) (equivalent to 79 +/- 6% (V) over dot O-2 max). There was no significant difference in the mean HR recorded in the first and second halves of a match.

The video-modeling procedure, which was organised over four training days, associated expert-modeling with self-modeling and quantitative performance analysis. Sixteen gymnasts were assigned to one of two groups: a modeling group that received video-modeling feedback, or a control group that received no feedback. The results are presented in three parts (pre-test, acquisition and performance analysis). Pre-test analysis revealed that the body was more aligned for the back phase than for the front entry and exit phases for both groups. Acquisition analysis showed that the modeling group gymnasts improved their body segniental alignment during the back phase quicker than during the entry and exit phases. At the end of this acquisition phase, the gains were 7.3 +/- 3.3% (back phase), 5.4 +/- 1.9% (front phase), 2.6 +/- 0.8% (entry phase) and 1.9 +/- 1.6% (exit phase). Performance analysis at the end of the training sessions revealed that, as predicted, the more complex circle phases (entry and exit) were less enhanced than the other two phases (front and back).

Retro-reflective markers were digitised for one complete stride to determine right sagittal plane joint angles and stride characteristics. Pole use versus non use was examined in each condition with statistical significance set at p<0.05. It was found that in all walking conditions there was a significant increase in stride length, stride time, elbow flexion, and radial flexion at the wrist with pole use. Significant, but not consistent, differences across walking condition were also observed in overall walking velocity as well as neck, shoulder, torso, hip, knee, and ankle angles.

It is equally undeniable that the Games have helped to unite the peoples of the world (unity in diversity)- serving as a forum for the festival of humanity, friendship, solidarity and peace. The Games are the largest peaceful gathering of humanity, seeking to promote international understanding and dialogue among civilizations, nations and individuals. Clearly the Olympic Games continue to fascinate the world. It is a great concern that the noble ideas behind the revival of the Games in 1896 have for some years now been put to test. Viewed from an historical perspective, there have been notable departures from the original ideals of the Games. Although the International Olympic Committee (IOC) has taken some positive steps to advance its agenda regarding the Games, there are serious problems and departures from the Olympic ideology that could result in diminished perception of the organisation thereby causing it to lose its credibility. The purpose of this paper was to analyse critical issues concerning the reconfiguration of the Olympic Games and to give practical recommendations. In order to address the key issues, relevant literature was reviewed and analysed. Content analysis method was used to critique available literature. Based on the analysis the problems and challenges facing the organisation of the Summer Olympics were identified and discussed. The findings and discussion were based on the following eight challenges and concerns facing the summer Olympics, on the basis of which recommendations were made regarding the future of the Games. These are: (i) size and number of summer games events and the monetary investment; (ii) increased number of drugged athletes (males and females) entering the Olympic Games; (iii) empowerment of women to the highest and most responsible positions within the IOC and NOC-ISF family; (iv) emphasis on Olympism rather than nationalism and recognition of the achievements of the athletes; (v) replacement of full time IOC members from the five continents whose skills and interest are political and are considered inappropriate in the 21st Century; (vi) the implementation of the ""Elliot Ness Untouchable Incorruptible"" syndrome; (vii) a drastic reduction in the size of the IOC members and (viii) the possibility of a permanent site for the summer Olympics. Future Olympic Games should be guided by the slogan ""bigger is not necessarily better in the Olympic World"". The Olympic Games should be different and unique from other global sporting events. It should serve as a model and indeed epitomize the organization of international sport.","Psychology,Psychology, Experimental",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,0,0.9491933891365472,0.19657938770898656,1.4676313400268557,-1.4599547386169434

Two bars differing in their distal shapes were used to manipulate precision: a cylindrical (Low Precision) and a semi-cylindrical (High Precision) bar. Children of all ages did not show the end-state comfort effect, even when the task demanded high precision for its conclusion. Instead, a start-state comfort was common with the right overhand being the preferred grip.

For this reason, and after taking into account all the parameters and special characteristics of the game, specific tests were constructed by expert beach volleyball coaches for the evaluation of the set, the pass and the serve skill. The sample consisted of forty (N = 40) BV players (21 male and 19 female), within an age band of 13-26 years (M =17.22, SD = 6.08). According to Safrit (1986) a test should first measure what it was intended to measure. Secondly, it should be reliable with reliability being defined as the degree of consistency of the test. Four types of validity were examined: logical, content, criterion and construct validity, and two types of reliability: internal consistency (intraclass) and stability of the tests were also examined in this study.

In Experiment 1, two groups of 14 participants (mean ages 20.4 and 80.4 years) each performed aiming movements in three conditions: (a) a single target (1-tap), (b) one target and immediately to another target without a change in direction (2-tap:extension), and (c) one target and immediately back to the start location (2-tap: reversal). In contrast to the younger adults, the older adults did not show the one-target advantage-instead, they showed a new phenomenon, namely a reversal disadvantage: longer movement times for the reversal movement than for the continuation movement in the two-tap sequences. This result was replicated in Experiment 2 that used electromyographic (EMG) technology to determine muscle activation patterns. The EMG data suggested that the one-target advantage was related to both preplanned strategies as well as movement implementation processes during execution.

Following beverage consumption and absorption, participants played a video poker VLT game for up to 30 minutes. Four behaviors were measured: ""power-bets'' (doubling bet after viewing only two cards of the five-card poker hand); total money spent; mean bet magnitude; and number of minutes played. Alcohol increased time spent playing and rate of power-bets, particular among the probable pathological gamblers. Post hoc analyses revealed that alcohol also influenced the proportion of losing hands played-increasing them among the probable pathological gamblers while decreasing them among the non-pathological gamblers. Clinical and policy implications of the findings are discussed.","Psychology, Multidisciplinary,Psychology",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,0,0.9994865153071708,0.021107555082261656,3.736472368240357,-3.837304353713989

This study investigated the effects of contingent gambling-drinking patterns and problem drinking severity on implicit gambling-alcohol associations. Participants were 144 (34 female) problem gamblers. The South Oaks Gambling Screen (SOGS) measured severity of problem gambling. The Brief Michigan Alcohol Screening Test (BMAST) measured severity of problem drinking. The Implicit Association Test (Greenwald, McGhee, & Schwartz, 1998, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 74, 1464-1480) measured gambling-alcohol associations. Participants who reported drinking when they won displayed faster response time (i.e., priming) on trials where alcohol words were paired with gambling win (e.g., jackpot) vs. gambling loss (e.g., forfeit) words. The tendency to drink in response to losses did not influence the priming effect of win cues or moderate the effects of Win-Drinking Pattern on priming. Severity of problem drinking on the BMAST also correlated positively the priming effects of win cues. These findings indicate that a tendency to drink in response to gambling wins and more severe alcohol problems each coincide with stronger associations between gambling win and alcohol concepts in memory. Such associations can promote drinking and its attendant effects (e.g., poor decision-making) in problem gamblers, and thus, may contribute to co-morbid gambling and alcohol use disorders.","Psychology, Multidisciplinary,Psychology",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,0,0.999433555966839,0.02202559454694781,3.681720733642578,-3.7938449382781982

This paper presents a basic scheme for analyzing the relationship between gambling and society. A theoretical starting point is that reciprocity is fundamental to social and economic systems. An anthropological theory of exchange systems makes a broad distinction between a structural dimension ( generalized versus balanced reciprocity) and a normative dimension ( from voluntary to involuntary). A model of four basic forms of reciprocity, each having a characteristic exchange mode and morality, can thus be constructed. Gambling is here understood as an exchange system embedded in the reciprocal orders of society and having a necessary relationship to these; it can take on the characteristics of such an order or it can be regarded as conflicting with it. Much of the variation in the form and morality of gambling therefore emerges as systematic and explainable by a theory of forms of reciprocal exchange.","Psychology, Multidisciplinary,Psychology",False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,1,0.30696545816176884,0.8276662177826549,-0.4261879026889801,0.3881567120552063

Probable pathological and problem gamblers earned significantly fewer points than non-problem gamblers. This was due to greater overconfidence among pathological and problem gamblers, which led to systematically less favorable bets. In Study 2, using 384 participants (105 female and 279 male, median age 20), control was independently manipulated and bets were constructed to make point value independent of overconfidence. Problem and pathological gamblers showed both greater overconfidence and greater bet acceptance.

In Study 1, exploratory factor analysis results revealed 4 empirically distinct dimensions of somatic symptoms: gastrointestinal problems, headaches, sleep disturbances, and respiratory illness. In Study 2, this structure was replicated using confirmatory factor analysis, and correlations of the PHQ dimensions with measures of negative affect, psychological health, and job performance provided further validity evidence. In Study 3, a minor revision to the wording of several items helped to address the limitations of one of the PHQ subscales.

Child health was unassociated with parents cutting back at work because of physical health. Poorer child health was associated with parents cutting back at work because of emotional health, and a portion of this association, as hypothesized, was explained by more limited opportunities for parental recovery.

A. Karasek, 1979) by examining coping as an additional factor.

Soldiers (N = 638) were surveyed before and during a 6-month peacekeeping deployment to Kosovo. Results partially confirmed the hypotheses. Even after controlling for general psychological health at predeployment, job control moderated the relationship between demands and psychological health during deployment when soldiers used active coping. No significant 3-way interactions were found for religious coping and passive coping.
