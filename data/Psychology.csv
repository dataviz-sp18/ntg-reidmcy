Second, we want to compare subjects that ask for more KR in the initial part of the acquisition phase with subjects that ask for more KR in the final part of the acquisition phase, and a possible interaction of both results with the complexity of the task. The Anova revealed statistical differences between the tasks (complexity factor) in all phases of the experiment and between groups (schedule of KR factor) in the retention phase, with better results for the groups that asked for more KR in the final part of the acquisition phase when compared to the groups that asked for more KR in the initial part of the acquisition phase.

The 9(th) FINA World Swimming Championships of Water Polo for men and women 2001 was chosen for analysis. In total, there were 60 matches for men, and 48 matches for women, each match produced data for two teams and thus provided the potential for the analysis of 216 team performances. An original database program designed specifically for water polo match analysis was developed and data were input immediately whenever an event happened during a match. In order to obtain an overall picture of game performance for our study, we selected 21 items for offense and 11 items for defense. Principal component analysis and varimax rotation were used to determine the factorial structure of the game performance. Ten common factors were extracted, which accounted for 83% of the total variance in the 32 variables. The results of present study indicated two key areas that determine the outcome of a game. First, the ability to counterattack impacts on winning or losing. Top-ranked teams more often than not convert their chances to score when up an extraman. Low-ranked teams often fail to score when playing with superior numbers. Second, the ability to defend when down a player impacts substantially on the outcome. The better teams are more successful in producing a blocked or saved shot.","Psychology,Psychology, Experimental",not explicitly computational,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,0,0.5898966848532845,0.5849674730613655,0.17892977595329285,-0.18460851907730105,Computational,Not Computational

Eight experimental machines were designed to represent every combination of the modifications. 210 participants played at least one modified and one unmodified machine. Following play, the South Oaks Gambling Screen (SOGS) was administered. More problem than non-problem gamblers used high denomination bill acceptors and bet over one-dollar per wager. Machines modified to accept the onedollar maximum bet were played for less time and were associated with smaller losses, fewer individual wagers and lower levels of alcohol consumption and smoking. It was concluded that the reduction of maximum bet levels was the only modification likely to be effective as a harm minimization strategy for problem gamblers.","Psychology, Multidisciplinary,Psychology",not explicitly computational,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,1,0.5073703776328696,0.6489344577206408,-0.034671582281589515,-0.0641552284359932,Computational,Computational

The introduction addresses research on social interaction, principles of dynamic systems, and of simulation. We proceed with a discussion of our interaction model, which is inspired by the theory of Frijda ( 1986). The model describes the continuous interaction between concerns, drives, emotional appraisals, emotional expressions and behaviour of children during each moment of the children's play session. The empirical validation of the model focuses on group differences ( averages and distributions of three types of dyads), which are based on a time-sampling of videotaped play interactions. The predictions of the model, which differ from those made on the basis of the current literature, are corroborated by our empirical data. The conclusion discusses the use of models in the explanation of social behaviour and development.","Psychology, Developmental,Psychology",not explicitly computational,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,1,0.2595374258396707,0.8690357355038181,-0.5047687888145447,0.5436053872108461,Computational,Computational

We outline those aspects of the social situation that must be processed for the infant to respond in a socially appropriate manner. We also outline potential cognitive sequences through which this information is processed.

Although the management of SMEs feel more positive and confident about their relationships with employees, they also continue to encounter a greater number of challenges than their larger multinational counterparts. These problems are inherent in their structure and predominantly emanate from human resources, outdated business models, and lack of strategic planning. Total Quality Management (TQM), long recognized as a major cultural change strategy for profitability and competitive edge, embraces the concept of total employee involvement in the form of teams. SMEs, however, have been slow to include employees in any ongoing collaborative work environment initiatives. Behind the shortage of sustained team formulation is uncertainty about its long-term durability, which can be directly related to lack of a continuing centralized organization and facilitation of the process itself. Human resources, often ineffectively used in SMEs, has the skills and knowledge to lead an ongoing breakthrough strategy of self-managed work teams in an effort to create a sustained high-performance work system. This article reviews the challenges human resource management faces in SMEs. The authors also present an example of how a human resource department led a lasting change management initiative of facilitating self-managed work teams throughout a manufacturing SME, which resulted in continuous and sustainable improvements in productivity, quality, turnover, absenteeism, health, on-time delivery, safety, and product design.","Psychology, Applied,Management,Psychology,Industrial Relations & Labor",not explicitly computational,True,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,1,0.011777354301399043,0.9986506148940468,-2.26455020904541,2.165179252624512,Computational,Computational

Its functionality derives from striking a balance between independence versus interdependence among component activities, e.g., fin or leg oscillations in lipfish and centipede models, respectively. A similar balancing act in the Ising (1925) model was found to produce patterns of electron spin alignment, analogous to the soft-assembly of locomotive patterns. The Ising model analog to relative coordination is metastability, and Kelso (1995) hypothesized that metastability is essential to sensorimotor functions across levels and domains of analysis, from individual neurons to neural systems to anatomical components of all kinds. In the present survey, relative coordination and metastability are hypothesized to underlie the soft-assembly of sensorimotor function, and this hypothesis is shown to predict 1/f scaling as a pervasive property of intrinsic fluctuations.

User-home interaction is sought through two, complementary, interaction patterns: direct interaction and mediated interaction. Integration between home appliances and devices and user interfaces is granted by a central point of abstraction and harmonization called House Manager. Innovative points can be identified in the wide flexibility of the approach which allows on one side to integrate virtually all home devices having a communication interface, and, on the other side, combines direct and mediated user interaction exploiting the advantages of both.

Fundamental movement patterns may arise by the coupling of different components, the strength of which being conditioned by the individual's developmental status. Mature individuals may show strong coupling among components which would be weak in novice individuals. Thirty-one children aged 4 to 5 years old had to throw a tennis ball as far as possible in a field.

The descriptive analysis depicted the frequency of developmental steps per component, the percentage of the children who showed variable behaviour in one or more components, the interaction between components' developmental steps from the comparison of the mode of developmental steps showed by each individual. As expected becoming skilled was associated with the strengthening of coupling among components.

Sixty participants were assigned to one of six acquisition groups, which were differentiated by the type of feedback (intrinsic visual KR or verbal KR) that was available during acquisition, and the frequency (10%, 50%, 100%) at which that information was provided. Participants were required to practice a beanbag toss for accuracy, followed by 10 minute, one day and one week retention tests. Acquisition performance improved with increasing verbal KR frequency but not with increased visual KR frequency. The retention results provide support for a guidance hypothesis for the role of intrinsic visual KR. Retention performance suffered with increasing frequency of visual KR with the 100% visual KR group demonstrating the worst performance. Similarly, the worst retention performance within the verbal KR condition was found in the 100% KR group. It appears then that the processing of intrinsic visual feedback conforms to similar principles to that proposed by the guidance hypothesis for extrinsic verbal KR.","Psychology,Psychology, Experimental",not explicitly computational,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,0,0.969095451050494,0.16148715052292387,1.766863226890564,-1.6785964965820312,Not Computational,Not Computational

Sixteen gymnasts were assigned to one of two groups: a modeling group that received video-modeling feedback, or a control group that received no feedback. The results are presented in three parts (pre-test, acquisition and performance analysis). Pre-test analysis revealed that the body was more aligned for the back phase than for the front entry and exit phases for both groups. Acquisition analysis showed that the modeling group gymnasts improved their body segniental alignment during the back phase quicker than during the entry and exit phases. At the end of this acquisition phase, the gains were 7.3 +/- 3.3% (back phase), 5.4 +/- 1.9% (front phase), 2.6 +/- 0.8% (entry phase) and 1.9 +/- 1.6% (exit phase). Performance analysis at the end of the training sessions revealed that, as predicted, the more complex circle phases (entry and exit) were less enhanced than the other two phases (front and back).

This article focuses on the social issues of sport in African countries. In order to address the key issues, relevant literature was reviewed and analysed. Content analysis method was used to critique available literature. Pertinent issues in sport in developing nations were identified and discussed. Analysis and discussion were based on the following issues: (i) research in sport; (ii) sport for the disabled; (iii) politics and sports; (iv) gender disparity in sport; (v) sport, peace and social integration; (vi) sport and economy; (vii) sport and migration of athletes (viii) management of sport; and (ix) professional issues in sport. These and other pertinent issues are discussed in the light of their implications for the future of sport in developing nations.","Psychology,Psychology, Experimental",not explicitly computational,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,0,0.9870305780451072,0.10766628775142598,2.2042486667633057,-2.1278579235076904,Not Computational,Not Computational

ANS responses during both competition simulation (concentration and shooting phases) and mental rehearsal can be analysed and compared. Fourteen participants took part in a modem pentathlon shooting competition and a motor imagery session. Five ANS parameters were simultaneously recorded in real time: skin potential, skin resistance, skin temperature, skin blood flow and instantaneous heart rate. Similar ANS response patterns were observed during concentration, shooting and imagery phases. A cardiac deceleration was recorded during both concentration and imagery phases and was related to an increase in focused attention.

We collected information about the usage of interval training, continuous running, uphill running, and strength exercise during the week throughout the seasonal training phases. Ten Spanish coaches, chosen according to their athletes' performance in International Events, took part in the present investigation. Interval running at 75-85% of (V) over dot O-2max and repeated running up to 85% of (V) over dot O-2max are mostly used in the build-up phases and less in the pre-competitive and competitive phases, whereas interval running at 85-95% of (V) over dot O-2max, repeated running above 85% of (V) over dot O-2max, and interval sprinting were mainly used in the pre-competitive followed by the competitive phase. Fartlek training and low and moderate intensity continuous running proved to be the most popular methods of continuous running throughout all the training phases, while high and low-high intensity running were mainly used during the pre-competitive and competitive phases. Continuous and interval uphill running is mostly used in the special phase and in a lesser amount in the basic and pre-competitive phases. Circuit training and resistance exercise are used mainly in build-up phases. Plyometrics and resistance running are used in a very small amount in all training phases. The training methods that elite runners employ to improve performance are mostly in line with research findings. However, in some cases recent suggestions, although proven to be efficient by research, seem to have no practical implementation.","Psychology,Psychology, Experimental",not explicitly computational,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,0,0.9942625020306464,0.07315070717825194,2.609954833984375,-2.545023202896118,Not Computational,Not Computational

Participants walked two times each with and without trekking poles over level, downhill and uphill conditions (slope=7%), in that order. Retro-reflective markers were digitised for one complete stride to determine right sagittal plane joint angles and stride characteristics. Pole use versus non use was examined in each condition with statistical significance set at p<0.05. It was found that in all walking conditions there was a significant increase in stride length, stride time, elbow flexion, and radial flexion at the wrist with pole use. Significant, but not consistent, differences across walking condition were also observed in overall walking velocity as well as neck, shoulder, torso, hip, knee, and ankle angles. In conclusion, both upper and lower extremity joint kinematics as well as overall stride characteristics were modified by bilateral pole use, possibly altering performance of the novice user.","Psychology,Psychology, Experimental",not explicitly computational,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,1,0.054451753158948436,0.986129644133648,-1.5008561611175537,1.3535937070846558,Not Computational,Computational

Thirty-nine children were divided in to three groups: 12 competitive athletes in gymnastics, 12 children with various recreational activities (novices) and 15 children with no after-school sports activities (non-athletes). Two experiments were conducted. In the first one, the participants had to walk with individual constant velocity in a transverse corridor under six conditions: eyes open, eyes closed, active head rotation (bilaterally) and a combination of the above. The second experiment included an angle reproduction at the shoulder joint (90 degrees flexion) under three conditions: visual occlusion and visual occlusion combined with active head rotation (bilaterally). In the first experiment the results showed significant differences between groups only in one condition: walking with eyes open and head turned left (p<0.05), in which novices performed better than gymnasts and non-athletes.

It is equally undeniable that the Games have helped to unite the peoples of the world (unity in diversity)- serving as a forum for the festival of humanity, friendship, solidarity and peace. The Games are the largest peaceful gathering of humanity, seeking to promote international understanding and dialogue among civilizations, nations and individuals. Clearly the Olympic Games continue to fascinate the world. It is a great concern that the noble ideas behind the revival of the Games in 1896 have for some years now been put to test. Viewed from an historical perspective, there have been notable departures from the original ideals of the Games. Although the International Olympic Committee (IOC) has taken some positive steps to advance its agenda regarding the Games, there are serious problems and departures from the Olympic ideology that could result in diminished perception of the organisation thereby causing it to lose its credibility. The purpose of this paper was to analyse critical issues concerning the reconfiguration of the Olympic Games and to give practical recommendations. In order to address the key issues, relevant literature was reviewed and analysed. Content analysis method was used to critique available literature. Based on the analysis the problems and challenges facing the organisation of the Summer Olympics were identified and discussed. The findings and discussion were based on the following eight challenges and concerns facing the summer Olympics, on the basis of which recommendations were made regarding the future of the Games. These are: (i) size and number of summer games events and the monetary investment; (ii) increased number of drugged athletes (males and females) entering the Olympic Games; (iii) empowerment of women to the highest and most responsible positions within the IOC and NOC-ISF family; (iv) emphasis on Olympism rather than nationalism and recognition of the achievements of the athletes; (v) replacement of full time IOC members from the five continents whose skills and interest are political and are considered inappropriate in the 21st Century; (vi) the implementation of the ""Elliot Ness Untouchable Incorruptible"" syndrome; (vii) a drastic reduction in the size of the IOC members and (viii) the possibility of a permanent site for the summer Olympics. Future Olympic Games should be guided by the slogan ""bigger is not necessarily better in the Olympic World"". The Olympic Games should be different and unique from other global sporting events. It should serve as a model and indeed epitomize the organization of international sport.","Psychology,Psychology, Experimental",not explicitly computational,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,0,0.9491933891365472,0.19657938770898656,1.4676313400268557,-1.4599547386169434,Not Computational,Not Computational

The present study examined whether young children plan motor actions on the basis of the end-state comfort effect and whether an increasing demand for precision would make the effect more apparent. Forty children (age range=2.7-5.9 years) performed a task of picking up a bar with one hand and inserting one of its distal parts into a hole flush with the top of a box. Two bars differing in their distal shapes were used to manipulate precision: a cylindrical (Low Precision) and a semi-cylindrical (High Precision) bar. Children of all ages did not show the end-state comfort effect, even when the task demanded high precision for its conclusion. Instead, a start-state comfort was common with the right overhand being the preferred grip.

The goal was to reveal the effects of long-term training by comparing novices with skilled athletes. The data collection technology consisted of a Vicon(tm) 3D motion capture system with 9 high-speed cameras (120 Hz) and wireless electromyography (EMG). Twenty female subjects (10 skilled, 10 novices), ranging in age from 19 to 24, were measured executing the maximal instep soccer kick. Results show effective upper-body movement to be a key factor in creating optimal initial conditions for more explosive muscle contraction during kicking. The EMG results also reveal that skilled players employ muscle control in a way that produces more rapid acquisition of maximal contractions and more accurate timing of the gross movement pattern. It can be concluded that long-term training leads to a control pattern which optimizes muscle lengths and contributes to explosive muscle activation for obtaining higher ball release velocity.","Psychology,Psychology, Experimental",not explicitly computational,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,0,0.9885728142171804,0.1043964670062683,2.2994720935821533,-2.160794973373413,Not Computational,Not Computational

Eight male trained subjects performed a test to exhaustion on a cycle ergometer at a constant power corresponding to their previously determined CP. Mean CP value was 283.6 +/- 20W and corresponded to 85.4 +/- 4.8% of VO(2)max. Time to exhaustion was 22.1 +/- 10.1 min and was associated with a pattern in lactate concentration, redox state, ammonia concentration, minute ventilation, respiratory rate, heart rate. Likewise, a decrease of [HCO3-] PaCO2 and base excess was observed between the 10th min and the end of the test, associated with an acidosis which cannot be compensated. The rise in these parameters could lead to exhaustion and the inability to maintain the exercise intensity. VO2 did not change after the 10th min of the test but was higher than the level expected for this intensity, due to a VO2 slow component though VO2 max level was not attained. These results demonstrated that CP does not correspond to a sustainable and physiological steady state intensity.","Psychology,Psychology, Experimental",not explicitly computational,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,0,0.9907155752283584,0.09394732099475044,2.3943982124328613,-2.275691032409668,Not Computational,Not Computational

Reliability was established using co-efficients of variation and intraclass correlation co-efficients (ICC). Within trial variation for the agility test was less than 3% for both testing occasions (CV=1.9% and 2.7%). Test-retest reliability was practically perfect (ICC=0.95). The inline agility test was very highly related to both forward skating 15 and 30m times (r=0.84 to 0.89) but was not significantly related to the backward skating 15 and 30m times (r=0.48).

BV as a new sport requires skill tests to evaluate the athletes' performance. Therefore, after a pretest to athletes, a training intervention program could be followed and useful results for the coaches could be obtained. For this reason, and after taking into account all the parameters and special characteristics of the game, specific tests were constructed by expert beach volleyball coaches for the evaluation of the set, the pass and the serve skill. The sample consisted of forty (N = 40) BV players (21 male and 19 female), within an age band of 13-26 years (M =17.22, SD = 6.08). According to Safrit (1986) a test should first measure what it was intended to measure. Secondly, it should be reliable with reliability being defined as the degree of consistency of the test. Four types of validity were examined: logical, content, criterion and construct validity, and two types of reliability: internal consistency (intraclass) and stability of the tests were also examined in this study. The results indicated that the BV skill tests were valid and reliable instruments and could therefore be used by coaches to test the ability of players to set, pass and serve the ball effectively.","Psychology,Psychology, Experimental",not explicitly computational,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,0,0.9781837394173728,0.1402224408842073,1.9675405025482176,-1.8355014324188232,Not Computational,Not Computational

This phenomenon refers to the finding that movements are executed faster when the hand is allowed to stop on the target than when it has to proceed and hit a second target. In Experiment 1, two groups of 14 participants (mean ages 20.4 and 80.4 years) each performed aiming movements in three conditions: (a) a single target (1-tap), (b) one target and immediately to another target without a change in direction (2-tap:extension), and (c) one target and immediately back to the start location (2-tap: reversal). In contrast to the younger adults, the older adults did not show the one-target advantage-instead, they showed a new phenomenon, namely a reversal disadvantage: longer movement times for the reversal movement than for the continuation movement in the two-tap sequences. This result was replicated in Experiment 2 that used electromyographic (EMG) technology to determine muscle activation patterns. The EMG data suggested that the one-target advantage was related to both preplanned strategies as well as movement implementation processes during execution. We discuss the theoretical implications of these findings for theories of motor control and aging.","Psychology,Psychology, Experimental",not explicitly computational,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,0,0.999059924239213,0.028862624624034213,3.4517486095428467,-3.5168609619140625,Not Computational,Not Computational
